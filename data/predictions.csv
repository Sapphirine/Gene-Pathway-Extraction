Results SLN detection recurrence DFS and OS were assessed in  patientswith NSCLC who underwent intraoperative peritumoral ICG injection NIR imaging and MLNS,SLN,OS,0
 On furtheroptimization of SLN mapping technology true pN patientsmay be spared  complete LAD because this potentiallycompromises subsequent nodal staging for  second primary lung cancer  relatively common occurrence amongpatients with  previous earlystage lung cancer,SLN,LAD,1
KaplanMeier curves of OS and DFS for pN patients inboth the SLN and nonSLN groups are shown in Figure ,OS,SLN,1
 Therefore we conducted therst retrospective analysis of longterm outcomes afterNIRguided SLN staging in patients with NSCLC andshowed that patients with pathologically negative SLNshave  statistically signicant lower recurrence rate andimproved OS and DFS compared with patients deemedpN after MLNS alone,SLN,OS,1
 The current study is not arandomized study of SLN versus MLNS alone because allpatients underwent MLNS or  formal LAD as per standard of care,SLN,LAD,1
 If  pathologic negative SLNcan be established to reect  true overall pN status insubsequent prospective multicentertrials additionalaggressive LAD may not be necessary in future patientswith small tumors and selective SLN mapping would stillallow targeted nodal staging if  patient were to subsequently develop  second primary tumor,LAD,SLN,1

 In addition the expression of ZEB wassignicantly downregulated in cells in which lncRNA XIST wassilenced,ZEB2,XIST,1
 These data imply that lncRNA XIST may inuence TGFinduced EMT by upregulating the expression of ZEB,XIST,ZEB2,1
 These results mean that the effect oflncRNA XIST on TGFinduced EMT may depend to some extenton the expression of ZEB,XIST,ZEB2,1
 Members ofmiR family including miR have been reported innumerous studies to exert  strong EMTreverting effect by inhibiting the expression of ZEB and ZEB in the manner of mRNA UTRbinding ,ZEB1,ZEB2,1

 RASSF is one ofthe RASSF family members but its function has not yet been claried,RASSF3,RASSF,1
Downregulation of RASSF strongly correlated with the progressive phenotypes of NSCLCs and EGFR wildtype status,RASSF3,EGFR,1
Ten homologues RASSF to RASSF comprise the RASSF family  review which has drawn considerable attention over theA,RASSF1,RASSF,1
RASSF to RASSF contains Rasassociation RA domain inthe terminus terminal RASSF whereas RASSF to RASSFhave  RA domain in the terminus terminal RASSF,RASSF1,RASSF7,1
In this study we found that the downregulation of RASSF expression was frequently observed in NSCLCs which correlates withlymph node metastasis pleural invasion EGFR wildtype status andadenocarcinoma histology independently,RASSF3,EGFR,1
 TaqMan probes for RASSF Hs m and GAPDH Hs  g were purchased fromApplied Biosystems and the amplication was performed on an ABIPRISM  Fast realtime PCR system Applied Biosystems,RASSF3,GAPDH,1
 The RASSF expression wasnormalized with an internal control GAPDH using CT methodand presented as  relative expression level using  ratio to theaverage of RASSFGAPDH of the mean of the  noncancerous lungtissues which was arbitrarily set at ,RASSF3,GAPDH,1
 The low RASSF expression group showed  signicantly worse prognosis in OS but not associated with PFS,RASSF3,OS,1
 Low expression of RASSF signicantly associated withinvasivemetastatic character nonadenocarcinoma histologyand EGFR wildtype statusTo determine the possible effects of RASSF downregulation onmalignant phenotypes of NSCLCs we divided  cases into two low   and high    expression groups respectively by themedian value ,RASSF3,EGFR,1
 Low RASSF expression was signicantly infrequent in the tumors with EGFR mutation  ,RASSF3,EGFR,1
 There was no relationbetween RASSF expression and KRAS mutation   ,RASSF3,KRAS,1
 In multivariate analysisTable  right column low RASSF expression was found tobe independently associated with nonadenocarcinoma histologylymph node metastasis pleural invasion and wildtype EGFR,RASSF3,EGFR,1
 Statistical analysis revealed that thelow RASSF expression group was signicantly associated withworse prognosis in OS for the patients   ,RASSF3,OS,1
 As we observed inNU samples similar associations of RASSF expression with diseaseprogression and EGFR mutation were detected in ACC samples Supplementary Table ,RASSF3,EGFR,1
 No relation between RASSF expression andKRAS mutation or TP mutation was also found,RASSF3,TP53,1
 DNA hypermethylation not  main cause of RASSFdownregulationIn order to determine whether or not low RASSF expression wasinduced by DNA hypermethylation we studied the DNA methylation status at the CpG island of the RASSF gene promoter regionusing lung cancer cell lines,DNA,RASSF3,1
The low RASSF expression group also showed  correlation withwildtype EGFR status in univariate analysis,RASSF3,EGFR,1
These data might suggest that the signaling pathways were regulated by RASSF and EGFR crosstalk inbetween and thus thealteration or mutation of each gene is mutually exclusive,RASSF3,EGFR,1
 Furthermore the possible interaction between the RASSF and EGFR signaling mightgive new clues to dissect the complicated pathogenesis of lungcancer which has long been virtually insurmountable riddle,RASSF3,EGFR,1

 Also  negative effect on OS was observed in the rstlinesetting in which the control groups in the  included studies wereVEGF pathway inhibitors plus CT,OS,CT,1
 Combined therapy resulted in longer PFSbut not longer OS compared with EGFRTKI monotherapy or CT orbevacizumab alone,OS,CT,1
 Theresults of the present metaanalysis showed that EGFRTKIs plusbevacizumab resulted in poor OS in rstline treatment comparedwith bevacizumab plus CT in unselected patients,OS,CT,1

 In conclusion we found that miR is silenced by histone modication in lung cancer cells and identied its function as  tumor suppressorand negative regulator of the mesenchymal phenotype through downstream IRAK and LAMP target genes,IRAK2,LAMP1,1
 A and Calu cells were treated with nM Trichostatin  TSA as HDAC inhibitors and  M azadeoxycytidineAZA as  DNA demethylating drug for  hours,HDAC,DNA,1

 Next we treated Calu and A cells withAZA  DNMT inhibitor and TSA an HDAC inhibitor and observed that miR was induced by TSA but not by AZA whichwas consistent with our microarray data Fig,DNMT,HDAC,1
 In thisstudy we selected IRAK and LAMP as direct target genes of miR by  website for searching miRNA binding motifs RegRnaAppendix Supplementary Fig,IRAK2,LAMP1,1
 To validate these predictionswe analyzed the expression levels of IRAK and LAMP after premiR transfection,IRAK2,LAMP1,1
 The expression of both IRAK and LAMP wasdownregulated in miRoverexpressed A and Calucells Fig,IRAK2,LAMP1,1

 In addition our qRTPCR analysis after treatment of HDAC and DNMT inhibitors suggestedthat the downregulation of miR in NSCLC is not associated withDNA methylation but rather with histone modication,HDAC,DNMT,1
 After conrmingthe predictions at the molecular level IRAK and LAMP wereidentied as potential targets of miR Fig,IRAK2,LAMP1,1
 In our present experiments on lung cancer cells silencingof IRAK and LAMP by siRNA resulted in similar effects in termsof cell migration and invasion to those of miR overexpression,IRAK2,LAMP1,1

  Additionally  AHNAK downregulation by UBEC overexpression eliminated pmediated inhibition of transcription thereby resulting in enhanced cell stemness,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
 Furthermore this is the first study confirming that lower UBEC and higher AHNAK protein correlate with longer survival time in NSCLC patients  Materials and Methods  Samples and cells NSCLC specimens embedded in paraffin were obtained from  patients who underwent  complete  surgical  resection  at  Zhongshan  Hospital  Shanghai People Republic of China in  following their providing written informed consent,UBE3C,AHNAK,0
  Furthermore  we  consistently  found that  levels  of stemrelated  genes  especially  sexdetermining  region  box    SOX  and MYC were higher in the UBECoverexpressing cells but lower after UBEC knockdown  Fig,MYC,UBE3C,1
 In the present study we found that fewer AHNKA peptides were detected in UBECoverexpressing C cells or D cells relative to those found in A cells  exhibiting  lower  UBEC  expression  suggesting    negative  correlation between  UBEC  and  AHNAK,UBE3C,AHNAK,1
  Furthermore  in  reciprocal  coIP  assays UBEC Abs pulled down AHNAK and UBEC was pulled down using AHNAK Abs Fig,UBE3C,AHNAK,1
 These results strongly suggest that endogenous UBEC forms  physical complex with AHNAK   We  further  determined  whether  UBEC  ubiquitylates  AHNAK  thereby marking  it  for  ubiquitinmediated  proteolysis,UBE3C,AHNAK,1
  IP  using  an  Ab  against endogenous AHNAK followed by detection of ubiquitin conjugates revealed that  AHNAK  was  multiubiquitinated  in  NSCLC  cells,IP,AHNAK,1
  The  level  of  ubiquitin conjugates  on  the  AHNAK  protein  was  lower  in  UBECdeficient  cells  but higher in UBEC overexpressing cells Fig,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
 Consistently AHNAK protein levels  were  dramatically  decreased  in  UBEC  overexpressing  cells  but upregulated in those  with  UBEC  deficiency Fig,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
  Moreover immunofluorescence  identified  colocalization  of  UBEC  and  AHNAK  along MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTwith  negative correlation in their relative expression levels Fig,UBE3C,AHNAK,1
 These results indicate that AHNAK is  direct substrate of UBEC and that elevated UBEC levels controlled the basal turnover of AHNAK by ubiquitinmediated proteolysis,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
  AHNAK reverses UBEC mediatedregulation of NSCLC stemness   To determine whether AHNAK as  substrate mediates the effect of UBEC on NSCLC stemness we downregulated AHNAK expression by RNA inference in UBECdeficient  NSCLC  cells  Supplementary  Fig,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
  The  results showed    decreased  percentage  of  CDcells  in  the  presence  of  UBEC deficiency  however  this  was  reversed  following  downregulation  of  AHNAK expression Fig,UBE3C,AHNAK,1
 Consistently decreases in both the number and volume of tumorspheres caused by downregulation of UBEC was also reversed by AHNAK downregulation Fig,UBE3C,AHNAK,1
   Furthermore investigation of stemnessrelated gene expression revealed that  AHNAK  downregulation  in  NSCLC  cells  increased  the  expression  of stemness  related  genes  especially  MYC  and  SOX,AHNAK,MYC,1
 Moreover both mRNA and protein  levels  of  MYC  and  SOX  were  upregulated  following  AHNAK downregulation in UBECdeficient cells Fig,MYC,SOX2,1
  Inhibition  of  cell  proliferation  and  cell  migration  caused  by  UBEC deficiency  were  also  reversed  by  AHNAK  downregulation  Fig,UBE3C,AHNAK,1
    UBEC  targets  AHNAK  to  remove  p  inhibition  of  stemnessrelated gene transcription Given that downregulation of AHNAK is crucial for UBECmediated NSCLC cell stemness we investigate the underlying mechanisms associated with this role,UBE3C,AHNAK,1
   Because both AHNAK downregulation and treatment with  p inhibitor increased  the  mRNA  levels  of  SOX  and  MYC  we  evaluated  whether  p binds directly to the SOX and MYC promoter regions to regulate transcription and whether this process is controlled by the UBECAHNAK axis,AHNAK,SOX2,1
 ChIP and qRTPCR assays conrmed recruitment of p to the putative MYC and SOX promoter  regions  in  NSCLC  cells  however  attenuated  AHNAK  levels dramatically reduced p binding Fig,MYC,SOX2,1
  Consistently in MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPTUBECoverexpressing  NSCLC  cells  harboring  low  levels  of  AHNAK  p binding  to  the  MYC  and  SOX  promoter  regions  was  also  suppressed  Fig,MYC,SOX2,1
 By contrast UBEC knockdown improved p binding to these regions whereas AHNAK silencing by RNAi decreased p binding Fig,UBE3C,AHNAK,1
 While AHNAK downregulation  derived  by  UBEC  overexpression reduce the  gene transcription  and  the  subsequent  cell  stemness  by  inhibiting  p  binding  to their respective promoter regions,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
  AHNAK negatively correlates with UBEC levels in NSCLC and predicts longer survival of patients To  assess  the  clinical  significance  of  the  UBECAHNAK  regulatory  axis  in patients we confirmed  negative relationship between AHNAK and UBEC levels as well as their correlation with the prognosis of NSCLC patients,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
 Additionally  compared  with  normal  bronchial  epithelial  BAESB  cells AHNAK levels were reduced in most NSCLC cell lines but especially in D A and H cells exhibiting high levels of UBEC Fig,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
 Moreover  further  analysis  showed  that  patients  with  both  high  levels  of UBEC and low levels of AHNAK have the shortest survival time,UBE3C,AHNAK,1
  These  results  suggested  that  elevated AHNAK  levels  and  lower  UBEC  levels  predict  better  patient  survival  and might represent  prognostic indicator of prognosis in NSCLC,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
  Our  results demonstrated the AHNAK was  novel substrate of UBEC and required for p binding to the promoter regions of stemnessrelated genes to inhibit their transcription,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
  Furthermore NSCLC  patients  exhibiting  both  high  levels  of  AHNAK  and  low  levels  of UBEC  displayed  longer  survival  times  relative  to  other  phenotypes  with these levels also indicating NSCLC prognosis Fig,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
 Additionally  we  identified  for  the  first  time  AHNAK  as    binding  target  of UBEC,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
   The  present  study  is  the  first  to  demonstrate  AHNAK  downregulation  in NSCLC  tissue  its  status  as    UBEC  substrate  and    role  as    tumor suppressor in NSCLC,AHNAK,UBE3C,1
 Significantly we confirmed p binding to the promoter regions of the stemnessrelated genes SOX and MYC to suppress their  expression,SOX2,MYC,1

 We further discovered that TGRknockdown prevented JAK and STAT phosphorylation and repressed the expression of STAT targetgenes thus inhibiting cell proliferation migration and invasion in NSCLC,JAK2,STAT3,1
 Moreover the promotive effects of TGR were signicantly reversed by  JAK inhibitor or STAT knockdown,JAK2,STAT3,1
 The most toxic LCA is the strongestnatural agonist of TGR followed by DCA CDCA and CA ,LCA,CDCA,1
 Western blot analysis showed that knockdown of TGR inhibited the expression of migration andinvasionassociated molecules such as RhoA ROCK MMP and MMP in NSCLC,MMP2,MMP9,1
 Western blot analysis showed that TGR overexpression promoted the expression of RhoA ROCK MMP and MMP,MMP2,MMP9,1
 We next found that the expressionlevels of cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D cyclin E Rb Myc CDK and CDK proteins in H and H cells treatedwith TGRsiRNA decreased remarkably compared with those inthe NC group Fig,CDK4,CDK6,1
TGR activates JAK and STAT at the protein and transcriptionallevelsIn the cytoplasm JAK is the major upstream regulator of STATand STAT phosphorylation is generally phosphorylated by activated JAK ,JAK2,STAT3,1
 Western blotting showed that TGR silencinginhibited the phosphorylation of JAK STATTyr and STATSerin H and H cells but had no signicant effect on the levelof total JAK and STAT protein Fig,JAK2,STAT3,1
 Tyrosine phosphorylation inuences nucleartranslocation and DNA binding activities of STAT which activatesthe downstream target genes of STAT,DNA,STAT3,1
 A while there were nodifferences in the levels of CA and LCA between the two groupsSupplement ,CA,LCA,1
 This cascade of eventspromoted the expression of downstream STAT target genes suchas cyclin D cyclin E Rb Myc CDK MMP MMP andRhoAROCK which are responsible for the growth and metastasisof lung cancer cells,STAT3,MMP9,1
 Moreover the accelerativeeffect of TGR overexpression on NSCLC cell proliferation andmigration could be reversed by the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinibINCB or siRNA targeting STAT,JAK2,STAT3,1

 BREAS binds to STAT and abolishes the repressive roles of STATon NRANRA has been revealed to be transcriptionally silenced by STATin  longterm manner ,BRE-AS1,STAT3,1
 To investigate whether BREAS regulates the expression ofNRA via STAT we rst investigate the interaction between BREAS and STAT,BRE-AS1,STAT3,1
 RNA pulldown assays displayed that BREAS specically bound to STAT but not EZH Fig,BRE-AS1,EZH2,1
 To investigate whether the binding betweenBREAS and STAT inuence the binding of STAT to the promoter ofNRA ChIP assays were performed in BREAS stably overexpressedand depleted NSCLC cells,STAT3,BRE-AS1,1

The results displayed that ectopic expression of STAT reversed the upregulation of NRA caused by BREAS overexpression Fig,STAT3,NR4A3,1

 BREAS is an antisense RNA to BRE,BRE-AS1,BRE,1
Our study identied NRA as  critical mediator of the tumorsuppressive roles of BREAS in NSCLC,NR4A3,BRE-AS1,1
 Moreover we found that BREAS upregulates NRA expression in NSCLC cells,BRE-AS1,NR4A3,1
 But NRA did not regulates the expression of BREAS,NR4A3,BRE-AS1,1
 In addition functional experiments showed thatdepletion of NRA reversed the roles of BREAS overexpression onreducing NSCLC cell viability repressing NSCLC cell proliferation andinducing NSCLC cell apoptosis,NR4A3,BRE-AS1,1
 Thus our data suggested that the upregulation of NRA by BREAS at least partially mediates the tumorsuppressive roles of BREAS in NSCLC,NR4A3,BRE-AS1,1
 reported that STAT could bind NRA promoter induceNRA promoter DNA methylation and repress NRA transcription ina longterm and stable manner in gastric cancer cells ,STAT3,NR4A3,1
 In BREASstably overexpressed and depleted NSCLC cells we consistently foundthat STAT binds NRA promoter in NSCLC cells,STAT3,NR4A3,1
 Furthermore usingRNA pulldown assays and RIP assays we veried that BREAS couldalso bind STAT,BRE-AS1,STAT3,1
 Overexpression of BREAS reduces the binding ofSTAT to NRA promoter,BRE-AS1,NR4A3,1
 Conversely depletion of BREAS increasesthe binding of STAT to NRA promoter,BRE-AS1,STAT3,1
 These data suggested thatthe binding of BREAS to STAT could occupy STAT and reduce thebinding of STAT to NRA promoter,BRE-AS1,STAT3,1
 Our data further found thatoverexpression of STAT reverses the eects of BREAS overexpression on NRA which supports STAT mediates the regulation ofNRA by BREAS,STAT3,BRE-AS1,1
However in this study we found that BREAS did not alter STATphosphorylation levels and nuclear translocation of STAT,BRE-AS1,STAT3,1
 But ourdata revealed that BREAS alters the occupation of STAT on NRApromoter,BRE-AS1,STAT3,1
 Therefore the binding between BREAS and STAT maychange genomic occupation of STAT,BRE-AS1,STAT3,1
 Other genes regulated by thebinding between BREAS and STAT need further investigation,BRE-AS1,STAT3,1
 ConclusionsIn conclusion we identied  novel lncRNA BREAS which is reduced in NSCLC represses NSCLC cell growth and survival in vitro andin vivo via binding STAT reducing the binding of STAT to the promoter of NRA and derepressing NRA expression,STAT3,NR4A3,1

Studies  report  that  EGFR  TKIs  achieve  therapeutic CSF  concentrations  which  accounts  in  part  for  intracranial responses Table ,EGFR,CSF,1
 Previous  studies  have  shown    linear  correlation  between plasma and CSF concentration of EGFR TKIs such as erlotinib suggesting that  higher dose may lead to higher CSF concentration  and  thereby  improve  CNS  disease  response,CSF,EGFR,1

 Low CSF levels are seen with other TKIs including gefitinib and erlotinib although the penetration rate with EGFR TKIs seems to be higher compared with that of crizotinib Table ,CSF,EGFR,1
 This suggests that approaches to increase the concentration of crizotinib within the CNS or use of other ALK inhibitors with greater CSF penetration may have therapeutic potential,ALK,CSF,1

Despite eective antitumor activity BRAF inhibitors resistance develops in  majority of patients and the most reported resistance mechanisms lead to reactivation of MAPK pathway see paragraph ,BRAF,MAPK,1
 Addition of  MEK inhibitor to BRAF inhibitor succeed toovercome or partially overcome acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitorsin vitro by blocking ERK signaling resulting in  signicant clinicaldelay in the emergence of resistance with no additional overall toxicity,MEK,BRAF,1
 Moreover addition of MEK inhibitor prevented paradoxical MAPKpathway activation that leads to development of cutaneous squamouscells carcinoma observed in BRAF wildtype cells whose RAS pathwayis activated through RAS mutation or through RAS upstream stimulation ,MEK,BRAF,1
 As previouslyseen in functional studies  MEK inhibition in BRAFmutated lungcancer cells led to tumor regression  thus sustaining the combination of concomitant BRAF and MEK blockade as the best treatmentstrategy ,MEK,BRAF,1

Given the activity of BRAF and MEK inhibition in melanoma metastaticto the brain  we can assume that also NSCLC patients couldbenet from the intracranial ecacy of the compounds,BRAF,MEK,1
With regard to the toxicities exerted by BRAF inhibitors alone or incombination with MEK ones they are similar to what observed inmelanoma patients ,BRAF,MEK,1
It has been purposed that secondary resistance mechanisms to BRAFinhibitors can be due to  reactivation of ERK signaling throughMAPK pathway  bypass of the MAPK pathway via activation of alternative signaling pathways  other unknown mechanisms Fig,ERK,MAPK,1
 Mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors can be simplistically divided into mechanismsthat lead to reactivation of ERK signaling through MAPK pathway left side and bypass of the MAPK pathway via alternative signaling pathways right side,BRAF,ERK,1
Reactivation of ERK signaling represents the main mechanism involved in secondary resistance to BRAF inhibitors in metastatic melanoma and can occur either upstream or downstream of BRAF kinase,ERK,BRAF,1
 Mechanisms involved include BRAF splice variants BRAF gene amplication  that increase levels of BRAF VEhomodimers or secondary mutations in other genes involved in MAPKERK signaling pathway that lead to BRAFindependent reactivation ofERK signaling such as NRASKRAS  or MEK  mutations  Fig,BRAF,MEK,1

Predictive Value of KRAS Mutation for EGFR InhibitorsThe  value  of  KRAS  mutation  testing  has  been  established  in  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  where  EGFR  monoclonal  antibodies  have  shown  greater  efficacy  in  patients with KRAS wildtype tumors,KRAS,EGFR,1
 KRAS is downstream from EGFR and it was hypothesized therefore that KRAS mutation  could  constitutively  activate  its  downstream  effectors independently of upstream tyrosine kinase receptor activation in particular EGFR and therefore could cause resistance to EGFR  inhibitors,KRAS,EGFR,1
 OS was also significantly shorter in the KRAS mutant subgroup treated with erlotinib plus chemotherapy HR ,OS,KRAS,1

 However  subsequent phase II trial of  previously treated patients with KRAS mutated tumors reported less optimistic results with median PFS and OS of only ,KRAS,OS,1
 EGFR mutation and KRAS are almost mutually exclusive and some but not  all  studies  have  suggested  that  KRAS  mutation  confers some  degree  of  resistance  to  EGFR  TKIs  in  patients  with wildtype EGFR,EGFR,KRAS,1
 Although the majority of studies suggest no statistically significant effect of KRAS in differential survival benefit from EGFR TKIs in NSCLC two metaanalayses suggest  that  KRAS  may  be    negative  predictive  biomarker  for response tumor shrinkage to EGFRTKIs in NSCLC,KRAS,EGFR,1
 At present the evidence is not strong enough for KRAS status to be used to affect EGFR TKI treatment even in those patients with  wildtype  KRAS,KRAS,EGFR,1
Although KRAS mutations in advanced colorectal cancer predict  lack of benefit from EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy  this  is  not  the  case  in  NSCLC  with  two  studies showing that KRAS was not predictive of response or survival outcome  when  cetuximab  was  added  to  chemotherapy,KRAS,EGFR,1
  The  failure  of  these  drugs  may  result from  upregulation  of  alternative  signaling  pathways  after the inhibition of RAS or the use of alternative cellular pathways for posttranslational modification of KRAS,RAS,KRAS,1

 Cyclin D is  target gene of IRXWe analyzed the correlation between IRX and G phase regulatorsusing the UCLA Gene Expression Tool Celsius  and found that IRXexpression was associated with CCND which encodes Cyclin DFig,IRX5,CCND1,1
 We then tested the regulatory eects of IRXon CCND and reported that IRX induced luciferase activity driven by bp region of CCND promoter but when the promoter extendedto  bpthe luciferase activity was signicantly enhancedFig,IRX5,CCND1,1
 Moreover IRX induced CCND promoterdriven luciferaseactivity in  dosedependent manner Fig,IRX5,CCND1,1
 H and deletion of homeodomain HD of IRX failed to regulate CCND promoter Fig,IRX5,CCND1,1

Rather than by direct interactions we found that MIAT indirectly regulated ZEB expression through spongingand suppressing microRNA miR which represses ZEB and interacts with MIAT in  sequencespecicmanner,MIAT,ZEB1,1
 Thus MIAT may inhibit ZEB expression and promote cell invasion of NSCLC cells via the miRZEB pathway,MIAT,ZEB1,1
 MIAT aected the expression of ZEB and the downregulation of ZEBinhibits cell invasionWe rst test the expression of ZEB in NSCLC tissues and we found ahigher level of ZEB both in vitro and in vivo Fig,MIAT,ZEB1,1
To investigate whether ZEB was associated with MIAT in NSCLC wecompared MIAT and ZEB expression levels in each tumor and  signicant correlation was observed value  ,ZEB1,MIAT,1
 We found that ZEB expression wassignicantly upregulated in MIAT knockdown cells indicating thatMIAT could inuence the expression of ZEB,ZEB1,MIAT,1

Original ArticleThe Pseudogene DUXAP Promotes NonsmallcellLung Cancer Cell Proliferation and Invasionby Epigenetically Silencing EGR and RHOBMing Sun Fengqi Nie Chongshuang Zang Yunfei Wang Jiakai Hou Chenchen Wei Wei Li Xiang Heand Kaihua LuDepartment of Oncology First Afliated Hospital Nanjing Medical University Nanjing  China Department of Bioinformatics and Computational BiologyUT MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston TX  USA Department of Oncology Second Afliated Hospital Nanjing Medical University Nanjing  ChinaRecently the nonproteincoding functional elements in thehuman genome have been identied as key regulators in postgenomic biology and  large number of pseudogenes as wellas long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs have been found to betranscribed in multiple human cancers,DUXAP8,EGR1,1
Mechanistically DUXAP represses the tumor suppressorsEGR and RHOB by recruiting histone demethylase LSDand histone methyltransferase EZH thereby promoting cellproliferation migration and invasion,DUXAP8,RHOB,1
 These ndings indicatethat the pseudogene DUXAP may act as an oncogene inNSCLC by silencing EGR and RHOB transcription by bindingwith EZH and LSD which may offer  novel therapeutictarget for this disease,DUXAP8,EGR1,1
 reported that the pseudogene PTENP functions in regulating PTEN by acting as  decoy forPTENrelated miRNAs such as miR miR miR miRand miR,PTENP1,PTEN,1
 The DUXAP RNA levels were normalized to GAPDH expression,DUXAP8,GAPDH,1
EGR and RHOB Are Key Downstream Targets of DUXAP inNSCLC CellsTo explore the entire repertoire of DUXAPaffected genes inNSCLC we further performed an RNA sequencing analysis aftersilencing DUXAP in H cells,EGR1,RHOB,1
  The cyclinD cyclinD CDKCDK and CDK protein levels were detected in H and H cells after transfection with DUXAP siRNAs or NC using western blot,CDK6,DUXAP8,1
 Among themthe knockdown of DUXAP signicantly increased the expressionof RHOB in both H and H cells while it increased theexpression of EGR in H cells Figure C,DUXAP8,RHOB,1
Therefore we assumed that DUXAP contributes to NSCLC byrepressing EGR and RHOB expression,DUXAP8,EGR1,1
 Consistent with theqPCR results knockdown of DUXAP also signicantly increasedEGR and RHOB protein levels in NSCLC cells Figures D andE,DUXAP8,RHOB,1
 These ndings suggest that EGR and RHOB are importantdownstream targets of DUXAP that are relevant to DUXAPmediated promotion of NSCLC cells proliferation and invasion,EGR1,RHOB,1
DUXAP Epigenetically Represses EGR and RHOBTranscription by Binding EZH and LSDMechanistically most of the previously characterized pseudogenesregulate the expression of their parental genes by functioning asceRNAs such as PTENP and BRAFP,DUXAP8,EGR1,1
 To determine whether DUXAP regulates the potentialtargets EGR and RHOB through binding with RBPs we performedRIP assays for some wellknown RBPs including PRC and LSD inNSCLC cells,DUXAP8,EGR1,1
 The results showed that DUXAP RNA could bind withEZH LSD SUZ TDP and HuR but its interaction with LSDand EZH was stronger whereas AGAPAS which could alsosimultaneously bind with EZH and LSD was used as  control Figures B SA and SB,DUXAP8,EZH2,1
According to the RNA immunoprecipitation RIP and RNA pulldown results we investigated whether EZH or LSD is involvedin the silencing of EGR and RHOB in NSCLC cells,EZH2,EGR1,1
 The resultsof qPCR showed that EGR expression was increased in Hcells transfected with siEZH Figure D whereas RHOB expression was increased in H and H cells with LSD knockdown Figure E,EGR1,RHOB,1
 To investigate further whether DUXAPrepressed EGR and RHOB expression by interacting withEZH or LSD we performed chromatin immunoprecipitationChIP analysis,EGR1,RHOB,1
 The results showed that EZH could directlybind to EGR promoter regions and mediate HKme modication whereas LSD could bind to the RHOB promoter regionsand mediate HKme demethylation,EZH2,EGR1,1
 These ndings indicate that DUXAP contributes to NSCLC cell proliferation migration and invasionpartly by recruiting EZH and LSD to repress EGR or RHOBtranscription,DUXAP8,EZH2,1

Silencing of EGR and RHOB Is Partly Involved in the OncogenicFunction of DUXAPTo investigate whether EGR and RHOB are involved in the DUXAPinduced promotion of NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion we rstanalyzed their expression levels in NSCLC and paired normal tissuesusing datasets from Oncomine,EGR1,RHOB,1
 Next we performed gainoffunction assays by transfecting EGR and RHOB overexpression vectors into H cells andRHOB vectors into H cells,EGR1,RHOB,1
 DUXAP Represses EGR and RHOB Transcription via Interacting with EZH and LSD qRTPCR detection of the percentage of DUXAP GAPDH and U in the cytoplasm and nuclear fractions of H and H cells,DUXAP8,EGR1,1
 ChIPqPCR of EZH and HKme occupancy in the EGR promoter in H cells and IgG as  negative control,EZH2,EGR1,1
that EGR and RHOB expression were signicantly upregulatedin H or H cells transfected with EGR or RHOB vectorcompared with that in control cells Figure A,EGR1,RHOB,1
 MTT and EdU assaysrevealed that EGR and RHOB overexpression inhibited H cellproliferation and RHOB overexpression also inhibited H cellproliferation Figures B and C,EGR1,RHOB,1
 Moreover Transwell assays showedthat increased levels of EGR and RHOB signicantly inhibited theinvasiveness of H and H cells Figure D,EGR1,RHOB,1
Furthermore to determine whether DUXAP regulates NSCLCcell proliferation and invasion in  manner dependent on repressingEGR and RHOB expression we performed rescue experiments,DUXAP8,RHOB,1
 The results ofMTT assays indicated that cotransfection could partially rescueDUXAPpromoted growth or siDUXAPimpaired proliferationin H and H cells Figure E whereas Transwell analysisshowed that the knockdown of EGR or RHOB could partially reversesiDUXAPimpaired invasion Figures F and G,EGR1,RHOB,1
 Finally correlation analysis revealed that DUXAP expression was inversely correlated with EGR and RHOB in  paired NSCLC tissues Figure S,DUXAP8,EGR1,1
These ndings indicate that DUXAP regulates NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion in  manner partly dependent on the silencing ofEGR and RHOB expression,DUXAP8,RHOB,1
 DUXAP Exerts Oncogenic Function Partly Dependent on Silencing of EGR and RHOB Western blot analysis of EGR and RHOB protein levels in H and H cells after transfection with EGR or RHOB vector,DUXAP8,EGR1,1
  Growthcurves of H and H cells after cotransfection with DUXAP and EGR or RHOB siRNAs were determined by MTT assays,DUXAP8,EGR1,1
  and  The invasive ability of H and H cells after cotransfection with DUXAP and EGR or RHOB siRNAs was determined bytranswell assays,DUXAP8,EGR1,1
 Similarlycompared with the normal HBE cells DUXAP expression was strikingly higher in six different NSCLC cell lines but not the SPCAand PC cell lines,HBE,DUXAP8,1
 Interestingly rescue experiments demonstratedthat the pseudogene DUXAP exerts oncogenic function in  mannerpartly dependent on the repression of RHOB and EGR expression inNSCLC cells,DUXAP8,RHOB,1
 This oncogenicity occurs partly through the epigenetic silencing of EGR andRHOB expression by interacting with EZH and LSD,EGR1,EZH2,1
 We found that DUXAP RNA accumulates in the nucleus andRIP assays revealed that it could directly bind with histone methyltransferase EZH and histone demethylase LSD suggesting thatDUXAP regulates gene transcription through epigenetic modication,DUXAP8,EZH2,1
 Moreover RNA sequencing in cells treated with DUXAPsiRNA and control siRNA showed that the expression of two newlyidentied tumor suppressors EGR and RHOB is signicantly upregulated after the knockdown of DUXAP,EGR1,DUXAP8,1
 Interestingly ChIP assaysrevealed that DUXAP could recruit EZH to the EGR promoterregion and repress its transcription via the induction of HK trimethylation whereas LSD could be recruited to the RHOB promoter byDUXAP RNA resulting in the silencing of RHOB expressionthrough HK demethylation,DUXAP8,EZH2,1
Interestingly EZH recruited by the pseudogene DUXAP couldrepress EGR transcription in NSCLC cells which may partly explainits loss in NSCLC,EZH2,DUXAP8,1

  SNPs  in  FPGS  and TYMS were also found to be associated with inferior OS andor  DFS,FPGS,TYMS,1
 Although  the  functional  implication  of  these  polymorphisms is yet to be characterized in some cases such as the TYMS rs SNP which was associated with inferior OS in this study it has been linked to FU cytotoxicity,TYMS,OS,1

 In addition addition of PRR abated the inhibitory effect of DLXAS on cell migration in H Fig,PRR11,DLX6-AS1,1
 DLXAS upregulated PRR expression by acting as  competingendogenous RNAs ceRNA of miR in NSCLC cellsIt has been proposed that lncRNAs functioned as ceRNAs throughsuppressing the expressions and functions of miRNAs which in turnregulate the expressions of specific gene targeted by miRNAs ,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 Collectivelythese results revealed that DLXAS upregulated PRR expression byacting as  ceRNA of miR in NSCLC cells,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 Together these results demonstratedthat DLXAS knockdown suppressed tumor growth in NSCLC in vivoby upregulating miR and downregulating PRR,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 In thepresent study we confirmed that DLXAS and PRR were significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cells,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 Similarly DLXAS was highly expressedindicated the poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC byregulating proliferation migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro,DLX6-AS1,HCC,1
 Additionally DLXAS was revealed to be upregulated in renalcell carcinoma RCC tissues which promoted RCC cell growth andtumorigenesis ,DLX6-AS1,RCC,1
 It was reported that DLXAS functioned as  ceRNA to absorbmiRa and thereby regulated matrix metalloproteinase MMPexpression in HCC cells to aggravate HCC carcinogenesis ,DLX6-AS1,HCC,1
In our study we found that DLXAS was positively associatedwith PRR mRNA expression in NSCLC patients,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 We further demonstrated that PRR overexpression reversed the effects of DLXAS knockdown on cell proliferation migration invasion and apoptosis in NSCLC cells,PRR11,DLX6-AS1,1
 To explorewhether DLXAS acted as  ceRNA of miRNA to regulate PRR expression bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay wereperformed in NSCLC cell,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 Moreover DLXAS reversed the inhibitory effect of miR on PRR in NSCLC cells,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 In vivoexperiments demonstrated that DLXAS knockdown suppressedtumor growth in NSCLC in vivo by upregulating miR and downregulating PRR,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 ConclusionsIn summary our study demonstrated that DLXAS and PRR wereenhanced in NSCLC tissues and cells,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 Depletion of DLXAS and PRRinhibited cell proliferation migration and invasion while induced apoptosis in NSCLC cells which was reversed by PRR overexpression,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
Moreover DLXAS and PRR were shown to interact with miRand DLXAS increased PRR expression by acting as  ceRNA of miR in NSCLC cells,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 Besides DLXAS knockdown decreased tumorgrowth in NSCLC in vivo through increasing miR and reducing PRR,DLX6-AS1,PRR11,1
 These results suggested thathsacirc formed by CDK gene inhibited the expressionof miR which could disinhibit the PDPK expression frommiR ultimately resulted in the promotion of cell proliferationinvasion and TKI inhibitor drug resistance of NSCLC cells Fig,CDK14,PDPK1,1

 Mechanistically RNA immuneprecipitation RIPand RNA pulldown experiment demonstrated that XIST could simultaneously interact with EZH tosuppress transcription of its potential target KLF,XIST,EZH2,1
Recently several lncRNAs have been reported to refer in progression of NSCLC such as LINC  NEAT  AGAPAS TATDN  and LINC ,LINC00473,NEAT1,1
 XIST represses KLF expression via directly binding with EZH in NSCLC cells,XIST,KLF2,1
 XIST RNA levels in immunoprecipitates with EZH antibodies is determined by qPCR,XIST,EZH2,1
 The level of KLF protein is determined by westernblot when knockdown of XIST in A andSPC cells,KLF2,XIST,1
pulldown assays conrmed that XIST indeed binds with EZH inA cells Fig,XIST,EZH2,1
 Nie and his colleagues reported that lncRNA ZFAS repressed KLF expression viainteracting with EZH in gastric cancer cells ,ZFAS1,KLF2,1
 To test this hypothesis we next explorethe role of XIST on expression of KLF,XIST,KLF2,1
 The qPCR results revealedthat XIST knockdown increased the expression of KLF Fig,XIST,KLF2,1
 XIST represses KLF expression via directly binding with EZHin NSCLC cellsLncRNAs could regulate their target genes expression throughfunctioning as competing endogenous RNAs ceRNA for miRNAs orinteracting with RNA binding proteins such as polycomb repressivecomplex  PRC leading to methylating lysine  in histone HmeHK ,XIST,KLF2,1
 qPCR demonstrated that knockdownof XIST increased mRNA levels of KLF and knockdown of KLFdecreased KLF expression Fig,XIST,KLF2,1
 Silencing of KLF is partly involved in the oncogenic function of XIST,KLF2,XIST,1
 XIST simultaneously recruits EZH toNDK promoter region and represses their transcription viamediating trimethylation of histone H at lysine  HKme,XIST,EZH2,1
These ndings indicated that XIST play key roles in EZH mediatedrepression of tumor suppressors in NSCLC cancer cells,XIST,EZH2,1
 Nie and his colleagues reportedthat lncRNA ZFAS repressed KLF expression via interacting withEZH in gastric cancer cells ,ZFAS1,KLF2,1
 In this study we found that KLFcan function as tumor suppressor and its expression could besuppressed by XIST through recruiting EZH to its promoter regionin NSCLC cells,XIST,EZH2,1

 The formation of MN and thepresence of chromosomal aberrations are events strictlylinked since the presence of MN in dividing cells isthe result of chromosome breakage due to unrepairedor misrepaired DNA lesions or chromosome malsegregation due to mitotic malfunction,MN,DNA,1
 In comparing results for CA andthe other assays it should be considered that the greatertechnical and methodological variations in the historicalSCE and MN studies may have weakened the strengthof the association with cancer risk Norppa et al,CA,MN,1
 Nevertheless little effort has been done to transform thegenerally accepted assumption that CA and MN frequencies reect an increased risk of cancer into  regulatorytool for improving occupational safety and health andpractically nowhere in the world has the use of CA inexposed workers been regulated by law Bonassi et al,CA,MN,1

As   TLR   induces   activation   of   Tregs   we   also  hypothesized   that   FOXP   and   TLR   may   have      correlation   inNSCLC   progression,TLR4,FOXP3,1
   The   expression   levels   of   FOXP   and   TLR   protein   were   detected   using   immunohistochemistry   in      postoperative   specimens   of   NSCLC   patients   and   in      normal   lung   tissues   from   excisionsof   benign   lesion,FOXP3,TLR4,1
   FOXP   expressionwas   closely   related   with   lymph   node   metastasis   and   TNM   staging   whereas   TLR   expression   was  closelyrelated   with   tumor   differentiation,FOXP3,TLR4,1
   The   Spearman   correlation   coefcient   indicated     signicant   positive  correlation   between   FOXP   and   TLR   expression,FOXP3,TLR4,1
   These   results   indicate   that   FOXP   and   TLR   maycoordinate   to  play      role   in   tumor   escape   and   subsequent   tumor   progression,FOXP3,TLR4,1
    we   also  hypothesizedthat  FOXP  and  TLR  may   have    correlation  in  NSCLC  progression,FOXP3,TLR4,1

The  above  results  demonstrate  that  both  FOXP  and  TLR  correlate  with    malignant  biologic  phenotype  in  NSCLC,FOXP3,TLR4,1
  In  addition  the  TLR  signal  pathway  may   participatein  regulation  of  FOXP  expression  in  Tregs  as  FOXP  expressionwas  further  upregulated  when  Tregs  were  costimulated  with  LPSand  IL  compared  to  stimulation  with  IL  alone,TLR4,FOXP3,1
  Therefore  we  suspectedthat  the  TLR  signaling  pathway  may   be  related  to  FOXP  in  lungcancer  cells,TLR4,FOXP3,1
  Spearman  correlation  analysis  conrmed  our  hypothesis  that  FOXP  and  TLR  protein  expression  in  NSCLC  tumor  cellsexhibited    close  positive  correlation,FOXP3,TLR4,1
  Therefore  FOXP  and  TLR  may   coordinate  to  promote  lungcancer  escape  and  development,FOXP3,TLR4,1
In  summary  FOXP  and  TLR  are  highly  expressed  in  NSCLCtumor  cells  and  strongly  correlate  with  malignant  tumor  phenotypes,FOXP3,TLR4,1
  Furthermore  FOXP  and  TLR  protein  expression  in  NSCLCtumor  cells  exhibit    positive  correlation  and  thus  these  proteinsmay   coordinate  to  promote  tumor  escape  and  lung  cancer  development,FOXP3,TLR4,1

   The   activity   of  MEK   inhibitors   appears   tobe   similar   in   patients   with  KRAS   mutant   and   wildtype   NSCLC   suggesting   KRAS   mutation   status   is   not   areliable   biomarker   for   efcacy,MEK,KRAS,1
   It   is   possible   that   mutations   of   genes   in   addition   to  KRAS   mutations   impactthe  activity   of   MEK   inhibitors   or  specic   subsets   of   KRAS   mutations   may   be  resistant   or   susceptible   toMEK   inhibition,KRAS,MEK,1
  The  identication  of  the  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  EGFR  mutations  andanaplastic  lymphoma  kinase  ALK  rearrangements  and  the  development  of  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  TKI  and  ALK  inhibitorschanged  the  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  approach  to  the  treatmentof  NSCLC  ,EGFR,ALK,1
  Previous  clinical  trials  investigatedagents  that  target  the  KRAS  pathway  by  either  by  directly  targeting  the  RAS  protein  or  by  inhibiting  downstream  proteins  in  theMEKERK  or  the  PIKAKTmTOR  pathways  ,KRAS,RAS,1
  However  the  activity  of  MEK   inhibitorsmay   not  be  limited  to  KRAS  mutant  NSCLC  and  may  be  synergistic  with  chemotherapy,MEK,KRAS,1

  In  additionto  RAF  proteins  there  are  additional  MAPKs  including  MAPKTPLCOT  and  MAPK  MEKK  that  are  able  to  phosphorylate  and  activate  MEK,RAF,MAP3K1,1
  MAPK  and  MAPK  are  not  directlyregulated  by  RAS  but  are  mutated  or  amplied  in  different  cancers  ,MAP3K1,MAP3K8,1
  BRAF  inhibitorsare  not  used  to  treat  tumors  with  wildtype  BRAF  because  of  aparadoxical  RAF  activation  seen  with  wildtype  but  not  mutantBRAF  leading  to  strong  ERK  activation  resulting  in  tumor  cellproliferation  ,BRAF,RAF,1
  The  ERK  MAPK  signaling  network  includes    MAPK  including  BRAFand   RAF  that  are  activated  by  RAS,MAPK,RAF1,1
  Additional  MAPKs  can  activate  the  MAPKsignaling  network  including  MAPK  TPLCOT  and  MAPK  MEKK,MAP3K8,MAP3K1,1
MEK  inhibitors  have  their  greatest  antitumor  effects  withtumors  harboring  RAS  or  BRAF  activating  mutations  because  theRAFMEKERK  pathway  is  generally  activated  and  contributes  signicantly  to  tumor  cell  proliferation  and  survival,RAS,BRAF,1
  However  thereare  examples  where  MEK   inhibitors  have  signicant  efcacy  withtumors  that  do  not  have  activating  RAS  or  BRAF  mutations,MEK,RAS,1
  Forexample  in  basallike  triple  negative  breast  cancer  where  activating  RAS  or  BRAF  mutations  are  rare  however  the  RAFMEKERKpathway  is  often  activated  due  to  genomic  amplication  of  EGFRKRAS  or  BRAF  ,RAS,BRAF,1

  The  similar  activity  of  MEKinhibitors  in  KRAS  mutant  and  wildtype  NSCLC  suggest  KRAS  mutation  status  alone  is  not  the  optimal  predictive  biomarker  for  furtherdevelopment  of  MEK   inhibitors,KRAS,MEK,1

 Introduction of RAS mutations in mice using either chemicalandor environmental induction or genetic modicationhas been shown to induce cancers such as lung adenocarcinoma and melanoma with perhaps the most wellcharacterised lung cancer model demonstrating thatlungspecic KRAS GD expression can allow mediation of both tumor initiation and multiplicity e,RAS,KRAS,1
 In terms ofisoforms NRAS is the most frequently mutated inmelanoma whereas KRAS mutation occurs mostfrequently in adenocarcinomas ,NRAS,KRAS,1
Following its description as  key cancer mutation in clinical investigation of RAS has been blighted byconicting results regarding its prognostic relevance aswell as unsuccessful clinical trial programmes mostrecently evidenced by the large phase III SELECTtrial which showed no improvement in progressionfree or overall survival with the addition of selumetinib an oral small molecule MEK inhibitor to nd linedocetaxel chemotherapy in advanced KRAS mutantNSCLC ,RAS,MEK,1

 However ACSL knockdown did not affect BMP expression at both the mRNA Figure Sand protein levels Figure D lower panels,ACSL4,BMP4,0
Interestingly ACSL is considered an important enzyme in energymetabolism and BMP is also associated with oxidative metabolism in cells as depicted in Figure E,ACSL4,BMP4,1
 Therefore we determined whether the effects of BMP on the production of main energymetabolites were catalyzed by ACSL,BMP4,ACSL4,1
 We found that BMP depletionsuppressed the enzymatic activity of ACSL and thus restored metabolites including fatty acids CH triglycerides and cholesterol esters in the resistant cells Figure F,BMP4,ACSL4,1
 Therefore the activation ofp expression by BMP depletion might affect lipid metabolismcatalyzed by ACSL,BMP4,ACSL4,1
 Taken together BMP seems to be associatedwith cancer cell metabolism through the regulation of ACSL andthe tumor suppressor p,BMP4,ACSL4,1
 We also revealedthat BMP regulates ACSL to affect lipid metabolism,BMP4,ACSL4,1
 The upregulation of BMP and ACSL leads to higher energy metabolism in resistant cancer cells enabling cancer cells to enhance cell growth and acquire drug resistance,BMP4,ACSL4,1
 BMP also interacts with ACSL and the psignaling pathway both of which are highly connected to lipid energymetabolism in cancer cells,BMP4,ACSL4,1

 In addition FGFR or RB knockdown inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and EMT,FGFR3,RB1,1
Conclusion This study for the rst time elucidates nicotinemiRbmiRFGFRRB regulatory networkthat nicotine promotes NSCLC cell proliferation and EMT by downregulating miRb and miR and upregulating their targets FGFR and RB,FGFR3,RB1,1
 These carcinogens are able to initiate and promote tumorigenesis primarily viaformation of DNA adducts and generation of reactive oxygen speciesresulting in mutations of vital genes such as p KRAS and Rb ,DNA,KRAS,1
 The expression of FGFR and RB mRNA were detected on ABI  realtimePCR system and were normalized to GAPDH,FGFR3,RB1,1

 Then the eects of nicotine on the mRNA and protein expression of FGFR and RB were determined by qRTPCR and westernblot assay,FGFR3,RB1,1
 The results showed that nicotine signicantly increased themRNA and protein expression of FGFR and RB in A and NCIH cells Fig,FGFR3,RB1,1
 To further conrm that miRb andmiR can regulate FGFR and RB expression respectively via direct binding to their UTR luciferase reporter assays were performedin A cells,FGFR3,RB1,1
 Knockdown of FGFR or RB inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation andEMTTo further investigate whether nicotine promotes NSCLC cell proliferation and EMT by downregulating miRb and miR and upregulating their targets FGFR and RB we silenced FGFR or RBexpression in A and NCIH cells and then performed cell proliferation and EMT detection,FGFR3,RB1,1
To deeper understand the molecular mechanisms whereby nicotinefunctions in NSCLC we predicted the potential targets of miRb andmiR by TargetScan and found that FGFR was one potential targetof miRb and RB was one potential target of miR,FGFR3,RB1,1
After exposure to  M nicotine qRTPCR is performed to determine the expression of FGFR and RB mRNA in A and NCIH cells ,FGFR3,RB1,1
 After transfection of A and NCIH cells with miRb mimics miR mimics or their respective controls qRTPCR is performed todetermine the expression of FGFR and RB mRNA ,FGFR3,RB1,1
 The protein expression of FGFR and RB are determined by western blot assay ,FGFR3,RB1,1
 Knockdown of FGFR or RB inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and EMT,FGFR3,RB1,1
and upregulating their targets FGFR and RB,FGFR3,RB1,1
 To test this speculationwe rst detected the eects of nicotine on FGFR and RB expression inNSCLC cells and found that nicotine treatment signicantly increasedthe mRNA and protein expression of FGFR and RB which were opposite to the eects of nicotine on miRb and miR expression,FGFR3,RB1,1
In summary our study for the rst time elucidates nicotinemiRbmiRFGFRRB regulatory network that nicotine promotesNSCLC cell proliferation and EMT by downregulating miRb andmiR and upregulating their targets FGFR and RB,FGFR3,RB1,1

  miR  was  involved  in  GAS  regulation  of  NSCLC  sensitivity  toDDP  through  PTEN  pathwayWe  have  demonstrated  that  GAS  could  regulate  NSCLC  chemosensitivity  to  DDP  through  PTEN  pathway,GAS5,PTEN,1
  Given  that  miR  couldinhibit  the  tumor  suppressive  effect  of  PTEN  and  promotes  NSCLCgrowth  and  invasion    we  further  investigated  if  miR  wasinvolved  in  the  process  of  GAS  regulating  NSCLC  sensitivity  toDDP  through  PTEN  pathway,PTEN,GAS5,1

  Additionally  it  was  found  that  GAS  wasinvolved  in  the  sensitivity  of  the  NSCLC  cell  line  to  DDP  throughregulation  of  PTEN  pathway,GAS5,PTEN,1
  Expression  levels  of  miR  and  PTEN  mRNA  in  NSCLC  tissues  and  their  correlations  with  GAS    and    Expression  levels  of  miR  and  GAS  in  NSCLC  weredetermined  by  using  realtime  PCR,PTEN,GAS5,1
    and    The  correlation  between  GAS  and  miR  between  GASand  PTEN  mRNA  was  analyzed  by  using  Spearman  rank  correlation  analysis,GAS5,PTEN,1
  According  to  previous  studies  PTEN  has  been  regarded  asa  major  regulator  of  chemosensitivity  of  cancers  including  breastcancer  glioma  colorectal  cancer  as  well  as  NSCLC  which  inspired  us  to  propose  that  GAS  might  regulate  the  chemosensitivity  of  NSCLC  through  PTEN  pathway,PTEN,GAS5,1
  As  expected  theprotein  expression  of  PTEN  was  downregulated  while  Akt  wasupregulated  by  siGAS  transfection  and  the  total  Akt  proteinshowed  no  signicant  change  suggesting  that  GAS  could  regulatethe  PTEN  pathway  to  affect  NSCLC  chemosensitivity,PTEN,GAS5,1
  However  themechanism  by  which  GAS  affect  the  chemosensitivity  throughregulation  of  PTEN  still  remained  unclear,GAS5,PTEN,1
  This  inspired  us  to  investigate  if  miR  was  involvedin  GAS  regulating  the  sensitivity  of  NSCLC  to  DDP  through  PTEN,GAS5,PTEN,1
As  exhibited  by  luciferase  reporter  gene  assay  miR  could  bindto  GAS  and  the  UTR  of  PTEN,GAS5,PTEN,1
  GAS  acts  as    ceRNA  for  miR  topromote  PTEN  expression  thus  to  suppress  NSCLC  cell  proliferation  and  to  affect  tumorigenesis  of  human  NSCLC,GAS5,PTEN,1
Since  we  have  demonstrated  that  GAS  could  regulate  PTENpathway  and  that  GAS  compete  with  PTEN  for  miR  bindingwe  then  hypothesized  that  GASmiR  affected  the  chemosensitivity  of  NSCLC  to  DDP  through  the  regulation  of  PTENpathway,GAS5,PTEN,1
  BesidesGAS  inversely  correlated  with  miR  while  positively  correlatedwith  PTEN  in  NSCLC  tissues  suggesting  that  GAS  may  serve  as  apromising  strategy  for  NSCLC  chemoresistance  and  DDPbasedtreatment,PTEN,GAS5,1

 Clinical outcomes of EGFR TKI therapy for treatmentnave patientsFirstgeneration EGFR TKIs getinib and erlotinib were developedfor competitively blocking adenosine triphosphate binding to the TK domain,EGFR,TK,1
  metaanalysis did show not statistically signicant but numerical differencesbetween afatinib and getinib or erlotinib in terms of PFS and OS particularly in patients with common EGFR mutations Popat et al,OS,EGFR,1
that frontline thirdgeneration EGFR TKI therapy is superior to sequential therapy of rst or secondgeneration EGFR TKI followed by thirdgeneration EGFR TKI in terms of OS or costeffectiveness,EGFR,OS,1
On the other hand newer sequencing technologies such as nextgeneration sequencing can detect EGFR mutations better with veryhigh sensitivity and also nd other mutations or genetic aberrations simultaneously which might be predictive for EGFR TKI therapy for example TP mutation Ulivi et al,EGFR,TP53,1
 Another study when using the sameMALDITOF MS method reported that those with TM mutationshowed  RR to rstgeneration EGFR TKI of  with  median PFS of,MS,EGFR,1
In addition signaling through alternate oncogenic kinase includingBRAF mutation HER mutation KRAS mutation and PK mutationwas identied as causes of primary resistance Chaft et al,HER2,KRAS,1
 However before considering combination of EGFR TKI with other TKIs targeting thiskind of alternate kinase such as BRAF or MEK inhibitor  couple ofproblems should be solved how to identify such genetic aberrations simultaneously or problems related to multiplex testing platform andhow to determine the effective or optimal doses of the agents usedwhich is related to practical problems of conducting those clinical trials,EGFR,BRAF,1
 Of more interest in  preclinical study primary EGFR TKI resistance due to BIMpolymorphism might be overcome through combination with HDAC inhibitors Nakagawa et al,EGFR,HDAC,1
Regarding TP comutation which was identied simultaneouslythrough nextgeneration sequencing NGS  highly sensitive and multiplex method might also play  modulator of EGFR sensitizing mutations with shorter survival outcome Bria et al,TP53,EGFR,1
 When using getinib there was  signicant difference interms of PFS favoring those who had EGFR mutation but wildtypeTP than those having dual EGFR and TP mutations  patientswith wildtype TP vs  patients with mutant TP  months vs months   ,EGFR,TP53,1
 Lee  Pharmacology  Therapeutics   Sloan Kettering Cancer Center TP comutation was found in  outof  patients and when treated with erlotinib patients with wildtypeTP had longer PFS than those with TP comutation wildtype vsmutation not reached vs  months HR ,TP53,HR,0
 From  study at Princess MargaretCancer Center dual EGFR and TP mutation was found in  of patients and compared to those with the dual mutation those withwildtype TP had slightly  higher response rate  vs   ,EGFR,TP53,1
 To date the combination trials of EGFR TKIs and HSP inhibitorsor HDAC inhibitors did not show meaningful activities Barlesi et al,EGFR,HDAC,0
However they were conducted in  different clinical setting that is secondline setting after failure of EGFR TKI therapy without knowing thebiomarker status or TP status,EGFR,TP53,1
 Therefore before further investigatingroles of this biomarker for optimizing EGFR TKI therapy we need moresufcient data or solid evidence of TP mutation status from the studies conducted or conducting,EGFR,TP53,1
 In order to help both practicingoncologists and clinical investigators the clinical denition of acquiredresistance has been proposed as follows  previously received treatment with  single agent EGFR TKI   tumor that harbors EGFR mutation known to be associated with drug sensitivity or objective clinicalbenet from EGFR TKI therapy as dened by documented PR or CR orsignicant and durable  months clinical benet  systemic progression of disease and  no intervening systemic therapy betweenEGFR TKI therapy and new therapy Jackman et al,EGFR,PR,1
 Activating  parallel signal pathway to bypass the inhibited EGFR protein by EGFR TKIs is wellknown another acquired resistance mechanism which involves mesenchymalepithelial transition factor MET human epidermal receptor HER broblast growth factor receptor FGFR AXL receptor and soon,EGFR,AXL,1
 Actually FISH test is the most widely used technique for identifying MET amplication but the difculty arises due to both MET andEGFR being on the same chromosome  and common nding ofpolysomy of chromosome  in NSCLC samples particularly EGFR mutant samples,MET,EGFR,1
 More notably MET amplication is alsofound in  of previously untreated EGFR mutant patients Bean etal,MET,EGFR,1
 There are many ongoing trials of combining an EGFR TKIwith  MET inhibitor after failure of prior EGFR TKI therapy includingcabozantinib XL capmatinib INC tepotinib MSCJ,EGFR,MET,1

HER amplication has been reported in  of   EGFR mutantpatients showing acquired resistance in  small study,HER2,EGFR,1
Secondgeneration EGFR TKIs such as afatinib dacomitinib or neratinibhave  capability of inhibiting both EGFR and HER but the clinical implication is unclear when considering their clinical outcomes and current development strategies as mentioned above,EGFR,HER2,1
 In analyzing paired specimens   of  patients showed activation of AXL and  had concurrent TM mutationsbut no concurrent MET activation while   of  showed activation of MET and  had concurrent TM but no concurrent AXL activation which means that activation of AXL and MET might be mutuallyexclusive mechanisms of acquired resistance Zhang et al,AXL,MET,1
PIKCA mutation and BRAF mutation was also reported in  and of patients showing acquired resistance but its clinical implicationshould be evaluated Engelman et al,PIK3CA,BRAF,1
 of  EGFR mutant patientsreached  PR with an week PFS rate of  Barlesi et al,EGFR,PR,1
 More disappointingly another phase II study of genetespib which is also  secondgenerationHSP inhibitor also showed again  disappointing result that out of EGFR mutant patients there was no response at all with  medianPFS and OS of ,EGFR,OS,1
There are everincreasing reports regarding resistant mechanisms ofthirdgeneration EGFR TKIs including  tertiary resistance CS mutation another tertiary resistance TI mutation PIKCA mutation BRAFmutation MET amplication HER amplication and even SCLC transformation which are very similar to those of rst or secondgenerationEGFR TKIs Chabon et al,EGFR,PIK3CA,1

 Current standard approaches for acquired resistancesGiven the heterogeneity of acquired resistance mechanism but lackof solid data of combination therapy except single agent thirdgeneration EGFR TKI therapy targeting TM mutation adding chemotherapyto EGFR TKI therapy has been thought  practical treatment option hoping that the one might act on resistance cells to EGFR TKIs and continuation of EGFR KTI therapy could still act on remaining sensitive cells toEGFR TKIs,EGFR,KTI,1

 Unlike SCLC which isstrongly linked to smoking behavior  history of never or minimalsmoking is the strongest predictor of harboring the EGFR mutationin NSCLC which strongly suggests that EGFR mutagenesis arisesfrom nontobacco carcinogens in fact the total number of packyearssmoked has been found in multiple studies to inversely correlate withthe rate of EGFR TK mutations ,EGFR,TK,1
 In over  of patients that haveprogressed on first and secondgeneration TKIs the mechanism ofresistance is an acquired threoninetomethionine amino acidsubstitution at the gatekeeper position  of EGFR in exon  orTM  which increases the affinity of the EGFR kinase domainfor ATP and thereby outcompetes the binding of EGFR TKIs theTMresistant tumor cells may arise from the selective pressure of aTKI or present de novo,EGFR,ATP,1
 In addition toTM the occurrence of other resistance mechanisms includingactivation of the MET pathway HER amplification mutations inPikinase and BRAF and transformation to small cell lung cancersupports rebiopsy at clinical progression to determine the molecularmorphologic changes and to personalize the therapy accordingly,MET,HER2,1
 However many new immunotherapyagents are under development including the inhibitory molecules TIMLAG IDO indoleaminepyrrole dioxygenase BTLA  andTlymphocyte attenuator adenosine and VISTA domain immunoglobulin containing suppressor of  cell activation and the stimulatorymolecules BB OX CD and CD,IDO,BTLA,1
 Several published case reports with aTKI  crizotinib  known MET and ALK inhibitor that hasdemonstrated activity in METamplified patients and other clinicaldata  support this assumption ,MET,ALK,1
 New strategies to prevent or reverse thedevelopment of resistance are therefore urgently needed and includeimmunotherapy concomitant EGFR  MET inhibition oncolyticvirotherapy epigenetic resensitization with subsequent administration of previously failed chemotherapies and potentially the discoveryof currently unknown driver mutations that synergize with all of theabove especially immunotherapy,EGFR,MET,1
On this basis potentially optimal sequential immunotherapeuticpriming strategies to trigger the release of immunogenic antigens fromdying cancer cells in TKI and chemotherapyfailed tumors mightinclude  pretreatment of  nonMETamplified tumor for severalweeks with an epigenetic inhibitor before starting  cytotoxic likecisplatin or carboplatin for four to six cycles followed by checkpointinhibition and  administration of oncolytic viruses in combinationwith EGFR TKI  MET targeted therapy in METamplified tumorsfollowed by checkpoint inhibition see Figure ,EGFR,MET,1

 Three prototypical RAS proteins include HRAS NRAS and KRAS,RAS,KRAS,1
 Therecruitment of this protein complex to the phosphorylatedreceptor enables SOS to function as the exchange factor forKRAS resulting in nucleotide exchange and the GTPboundform of KRAS Fig,SOS,KRAS,1
KRAS mutations and role in CRCNearly  of human cancers possess activating RAS mutations  of which are KRAS mutations,RAS,KRAS,1
 In CRCs KRASmutations are found in approximately e of cases andthose of HRAS and NRAS in ,HRAS,NRAS,1
 Using isogenic knockout and knockin CRC cell lines with either WT KRAS or activating mutationsrecent studies have illustrated that these mutations play asignicant role in tumor cell survival and tumor progression,WT,KRAS,1
  Activation of EGFR upon ligand binding and its subsequentFigure autophosphorylation create  docking site for the SOSGRB complex resulting in nucleotide exchange by SOS and the GTPboundform of KRAS,EGFR,SOS,1
 Given the role of KRAS as  key downstreameffector of EGFR signaling it is perhaps not surprising thatconstitutive activation of KRAS by mutations bypasses theupstream effect of EGFR inhibition,KRAS,EGFR,1
 For example in silico and NMRbasedscreens were used to identify small molecules that bindto  distinct pocket on KRAS and inhibit SOSmediatednucleotide exchange to prevent the activation of WT ormutant KRAS,KRAS,WT,1

Cleaved PARP acts as  reliable marker for the suppression of DNA repair and induction of apoptosis ,PARP,DNA,1
Separately high ERCC and XPA levels have been implicated to produce resistance to platinum based chemotherapy due to their ability torepair DNA damage done by platinum adducts ,ERCC1,XPA,1
 Therefore lowerlevels of ERCC and XPA offer  good prognosis for tumor growthACY,ERCC1,XPA,1
Polymet combined with CDDP into NPs will decrease the XPA and ERCC and increased the cleaved PARP,XPA,PARP,1
 Comparing PEICDDP NPs polymetCDDP NPs could decrease ERCC XPA and increase Cleaved PARP more efciently,XPA,PARP,1
 Results indicated that tumors treated with polymetCDDP NPs expressed signicantly decreasedexpression of ERCC and XPA in comparison to tumors treated with onlyPEICDDP NPs or polymet NPs Fig,ERCC1,XPA,1
 A and  treatment with polymet alone producesonly negligible differences in the expression of ERCC and XPA,ERCC1,XPA,1
 On the other hand  combination of CDDP and polymet resultsin the ablation of both ERCC and XPA expression to levels lower thanthe PBS control,ERCC1,XPA,1
In summary the combination of CDDP and polymet allows thedownregulation of ERCC and XPA key DNA repair proteins that prevent platinum adductbased apoptosis,ERCC1,DNA,1
 Downregulation of ERCC andXPA are followed by increased cell apoptosis as determined by theincrease in level of cleaved PARP and decrease of uncleaved PARP,ERCC1,PARP,1
 In vitro test certied that polymet combined with CDDP will decrease the XPA and ERCC and increased the Cleaved PARP,XPA,PARP,1

The FA pathway controls DNA replication and contributes togenomic stability being able to overcome most or all forms of replication stress including DDPinduced ICLs ,FA,DNA,1
 Many FA complementation group FANC proteins assist DNA replication copingwith polymeraseblocking lesions to minimize both the occurrenceand persistence of DSBs,FA,DNA,1
 It has been suggested that all the DNA base damages and SSBsremaining as DNA replicates need FANC proteins processing toboth prevent DNA replication fork collapse and to potentiallyrestore broken forks by HR ,DNA,HR,1
HR represents the backup pathway for various unrepaired DNAlesions and is the second major mechanism involved in the removalof replication blocking DNA crosslinks including platinum DNAadducts ,HR,DNA,1
 BRCA and BRCA are key playersin HR mechanisms,BRCA1,BRCA2,1
  which showedthat combination of both low levels of BRCA and pbinding protein BP were predictive of better PFS and OS,BRCA1,OS,1
 the central event during FA pathway activationcan be monitored by immunouorescence microscopic analysis ofdiscrete nuclear FANCD foci,FA,FANCD2,1
 These foci also contain the HR proteins BRCA and RAD as well as the replication fork componentsPCNA and RPA ,HR,BRCA1,1
 Screening  NSCLC cell lines revealed  close correlation between impaired RAD foci formation in   lines following crosslinkerDDP mitomycin  or PARP inhibitorolaparib treatment elevated cHAX foci signals and increasedsensitivity to these drugs as determined by colony formation analysis,RAD51,PARP,1
 HR dysfunction in these  cell lines could be explained eitherby ATMATR gene mutations or reduced FANCD and BRCAexpression,HR,FANCD2,1
 Assaying DDPinduced RAD foci formation in NSCLC explants ex vivo identied   tumors with an HRdefect notably without changes in ERCC expression,RAD51,ERCC1,1
 The authorsconcluded that HR analysis via RAD andor cHAX foci quantication may serve as  novel biomarker predicting treatmentresponses to HR targeting drugs,HR,RAD51,1
 Of note EGFR mutated NSCLC also showedimproved responsiveness to platinumbased chemotherapy and increased olaparib sensitivity in vitro and in vivo  suggesting  defect in replicationassociated HR,EGFR,HR,1
 Pffe and colleagues discovered  FAlike repair phenotype in EGFR mutated lungcancer celllines covering classical diagnostic traits such ascrosslinkerinduced G cell cycle arrest and chromosomal radialformation as well as  DNA repair defect downstream of FANCD,EGFR,DNA,1

 The IALT group  studied levels of MSH expressionin IHC as well as ERCC expression,MSH2,ERCC1,1
In addition platinumbasedchemotherapy prolonged OS in specic subgroups such as combined low MSHlow ERCC HR ,OS,ERCC1,1
 In  retrospective series of stage IIIIV NSCLC patientsplatinumbased chemotherapy and the loss of MLH or MSHexpression have been correlated with better RR and better survivalcompared to normal MLH and MSH expression ,MLH1,MSH2,1
 In theIALTbio analysis the impact of PARP has been studied rst considering expression together with ERCC and MSH and secondlyregarding pharmacological inhibition of PARP causing  ,PARP1,ERCC1,1
 Thepredictive role of combined ERCC and PARP high expressionwas conrmed in  Chinese study where however no correlationwas found between MSH expression and platinumtherapy ,ERCC1,PARP1,1

 The sensitivity and specicity for the ARMS EGFR mutation test in the plasma comparedwith tumor tissue were   and   respectively,ARMS,EGFR,1
Conclusions The detection of EGFR mutations in plasma using ARMS is relatively sensitive and highly specic,EGFR,ARMS,1
However EGFR mutation status tested by ARMS in plasma cannot replace  tumor tissue biopsy,EGFR,ARMS,1
 Surgical samples are not available for the majorityof NSCLC cases but other available DNA sources include small biopsiesand cytological samples providing limited and potentially lowqualitymaterial for EGFR testing,DNA,EGFR,0
 Human EGFR Gene Mutation Fluorescence Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR Diagnostic Kit Amoy Diagnostics Xiamen China whichwas based on ARMS technology was used to analyze the DNA fromthe tissue and plasma samples,EGFR,ARMS,0
 Compared withtumor tissue the sensitivity and specicity for EGFR mutation detectionin plasma by ARMS were   and   respectively,EGFR,ARMS,1
In the univariate analysis the median OS was longer for those withEGFR mutations than for those without EGFR mutations both in tissue,OS,EGFR,1
 In all  patients according to type of mutation in plasma OS was longer for patients with EGFR mutation status in  and ,OS,EGFR,1
 The method of ARMS for EGFR mutation detection in plasmactDNA has moderate sensitivity but high specicity Luo et al,ARMS,EGFR,1
 Additionally compared with tumor tissue the sensitivity and specicity of EGFR mutation detection in plasmaby ARMS were  and  respectively,EGFR,ARMS,1
Thus EGFR mutationnegative results in plasma should be interpretedwith caution as  of patients with EGFR mutant tumors were not detected in plasma ctDNA by ARMS,EGFR,ARMS,1
In the univariate analysis the median OS was longer for those withEGFR mutations than for those without EGFR mutations both in tissue,OS,EGFR,1
 Our study showed that thesensitivity of EGFR mutation detection in plasma by ARMS was  but of patients with EGFR mutant tumors were not detected in plasmaby ARMS possibly due to the low amount of mutant ctDNA,EGFR,ARMS,1

 Multivariate Cox regression analysis reveals that SNHG expression could beregarded as an independent predictor for DFS and OS in NSCLC patients,SNHG16,OS,1
 For example in NSCLC lncRNA HOTAIR MALAT and MVIH indicate  poor prognosis and induce metastasis low expression of lncRNA PANDARpredicts  poor prognosis and affects cell apoptosis by regulating Bcl and lncRNA PVT promotes cancer cell proliferation through epigenetically regulating LATS expression ,MALAT1,PVT1,1
 The expression ofSNHG and MUCAC mRNA was quantied on ABI  realtimePCR system and actin was used as an internal control,MUC5AC,ABI,1
 Cells werecotransfected with the WT or MUT reporter plasmid and miRamimic or mimic control,WT,MUT,1
Plasmid complementary DNA SNHG cDNA pcDNASNHG wasconstructed by amplication and introduction of SNHG cDNA sequence into the pcDNA,DNA,SNHG16,1
 To further investigate whether SNHG expression was relatedwith the prognosis of NSCLC patients DFS and OS curves were plottedand analyzed by the KaplanMeier analysis and logrank test,SNHG16,OS,1
 A and  NSCLC patients with high SNHG expressionlevel had  shorter DFS and OS than those with low SNHG expressionlevel,SNHG16,OS,1
 Moreover in  multivariate Cox model we found that SNHG expression and TNM stage could be regarded as independent predictorsfor DFS and OS in NSCLC patients Table ,SNHG16,OS,1
 SNHG regulates MUCAC expression by targeting miRaSeveral reports suggest that MUCAC are overexpressed in NSCLC andcorrelated with disease progression,SNHG16,MUC5AC,1
 Based on these ndings we further investigated whether SNHG could regulate MUCAC expression bytargeting miRa,SNHG16,MUC5AC,1
 MUCAC mRNA level had  signicant positive correlation with SNHG expression and  signicant negative correlation with miRa expression Fig,MUC5AC,SNHG16,1
 The results showed that miRa overexpression or SNHG knockdown signicantly inhibited MUCAC protein expression while the cotransfection of miRa mimic andpcDNASNHG regained MUCAC protein expression level Fig,SNHG16,MUC5AC,1
 For example SNHG contributes to NSCLC progression through inhibition of miRp and activation of Wntcatenin pathway andSNHG promotes the proliferation migration and invasion and inhibitsapoptosis of lung cancer cells by enhancing the FAIM expression,SNHG1,FAIM2,1
In this study we found that SNHG was aberrantly upregulated inNSCLC tissues and higher expression of SNHG was correlated withlarger tumor size advanced TNM stage lymph node metastasis shorterDFS and OS,SNHG16,OS,1
 For example lncRNAHOTAIR functions as  ceRNA to regulate HER expression by spongingmiRp in gastric cancer lncRNA H competitively binds miRp to regulate YES expression in thyroid cancer lncRNA XIST promotescell growth and invasion through regulating miRMACC axis ingastric cancer and SNHG contributes to breast cancer cell migrationFig,HER2,H19,1

                cCombinatory inhibition of TRIM and MDM in lung cancer cellsGeng Chen  Tong Zhou  Ying Liu  Zhenxiang Yu   Department of Gastroenterology The First Hospital of Jilin University Changchun  Chinab Department of Endocrinology The First Hospital of Jilin University Changchun  Chinac Department of Respiration The First Hospital of Jilin University Changchun  Chinaa          oa       tArticle historyReceived  October Accepted  October Available online  October KeywordsTRIMMDMpLung cancerTherapeuticsIn addition to the involvement in white matter lesion tripartitemotif protein family member TRIM has also been implicated in tumorigenesis as  potential oncogene,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 In thepresent study we found that TRIM binds to the terminus of p tumor suppressor and thuscompetes with MDM for p binding,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 Intriguingly analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA genealteration database revealed that elevated expression of TRIM is mutually exclusive to MDM upregulation in human lung adenocarcinoma patients indicating potential compensatory effect of oneover the other,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 Indeed overexpression of TRIM renders lung cancer cell line resistance to Nutlina aneffective MDM inhibitor as determined by p activation and cell proliferation assays,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 Furthermoreanalysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA database revealedmutual exclusivity of MDM and TRIM overexpression in humanlung adenocarcinoma samples,MDM2,TRIM65,1
 TRIM binds to p terminus and competes with MDM forp bindingWe previously reported that TRIM could bind to p forubiquitination and degradation  but the site of p responsiblefor TRIM binding has not been determined,TRIM65,MDM2,1
As we found that TRIM binds to p through its terminusTAD the same site MDM binds to we next wanted to assesswhether TRIM has any inuence on MDMp binding,TRIM65,MDM2,1
Collectively these data suggest that TRIM binds to the terminus TAD of p and therefore can compete with MDM forp binding,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 Elevated expression of TRIM and MDM is mutuallyexclusive in lung adenocarcinoma patientsBased on the observations described above and other studiesshowing TRIM is overexpressed in human lung cancer  wehypothesized that it could be  prosurvival strategy for cancer cellsto overexpress TRIM when MDM elevation is not achievable,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 Intriguingly the samples with TRIMelevation have no MDM alterations at all indicating that elevatedexpression of TRIM and MDM is mutually exclusive to eachother,MDM2,TRIM65,1
 These results are in support of our hypothesisthat human lung tumor cells could strategicallyoverexpress TRIM as an alternative approach to promote cancercell survival when MDM level remains unchanged and fails toinhibit p activity ,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 TRIM overexpression renders lung cancer cells resistance toMDM inhibitionAs we have demonstrated that TRIM can potentially competewith MDM for p binding and overexpression of these two genestends to occur in different populations of human lung adenocarcinoma patients it is conceivable that TRIM may compensate thelost suppressive effects against p by MDM inhibition,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 TRIM competes with MDM for binding to p terminus TAD,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 Mutually exclusive elevation of MDM and TRIM,MDM2,TRIM65,1
  OncoPrint results showing individual genealteration status of TRIM and MDM from two sets of lung adenocarcinoma database,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 Combinatory inhibition of MDM and TRIM synergisticallysuppresses lung cancer cell survivalBased on our ndings we next sought to test the potentialeffects of combinatory inhibition of MDM and TRIM on ppathway activation and lung cancer cell survival,MDM2,TRIM65,1
 In summary these resultsdemonstrated that combinatory inhibition of MDM using Nutlina and TRIM by siRNA could synergistically activate p pathwayand subsequently suppress lung cancer cell survival,MDM2,TRIM65,1
In the present study we further validated that the binding site ofp for TRIM is located at the terminus transactivationdomain which overlaps with the site for MDM binding Fig,TRIM65,MDM2,1
Consequently TRIM competes with MDM for binding to pFig,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 As MDM overexpression is often found in human cancersas an approach to inactivate p  our data suggest that cancercells may upregulate TRIM as an alternative option for p inhibition in case that MDM overexpression is not achievable,MDM2,TRIM65,1
 Indeed ectopic expression of TRIM impaired p activation and cell growth inhibition by MDM inhibitor NutlinaFig,TRIM65,MDM2,1
It is not clear if the mutually exclusive elevation of TRIM andMDM is  consequence of temporal responses for cancer cells toupregulate these two genes to impair p activation or there is aninterplay between TRIM and MDM which keeps one activatedwhen the other fails to function,TRIM65,MDM2,1
 In either scenario it would bebenecial to target MDM and TRIM simultaneously for pactivation,MDM2,TRIM65,1

 PCAT silences LATS transcription by binding with HK methyltransferase EZHTo identify the functional processes that were affected by PCATmediated transcriptional regulation GO analysis was performed,PCAT6,LATS2,1

 An RNARIP assay was performed to further evaluatewhether PCAT inhibits LATS expression at transcriptional levelthrough  similar mechanism,PCAT6,LATS2,1
 In ourprevious study qRTPCR results demonstrated that the inhibition ofEZH expression led to increased LATS expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that EZH could directly bind tothe LATS promoter region and mediate HK trimethylationX,LATS2,EZH2,1
  The PCAT expression level in  NSCLC tissues and corresponding adjacent nontumor tissues was quantied by Quantitative realtime PCR analysisand normalized to GAPDH expression,PCAT6,GAPDH,1
 Based on these observations we suggested that PCAT overexpression might decrease LATS promoter activity via binding to EZHresulted in HK trimethylation in the LATS promoter region,PCAT6,LATS2,1

 The RIP and ChIP assay revealed thatPCAT could directly bind with EZH and EZH could directly bind tothe LATS promoter region in NSCLC cells,EZH2,LATS2,1

  higher BMI was associated with improved OS after surgicalresection of NSCLC,BMI,OS,1
Our study aimed to contribute to prior work on thistopic by evaluating the impact of BMI on OS in  largecohort of patients with surgically resected NSCLC,BMI,OS,1
 KaplanMeier analyses of propensityscorematched patients demonstrated signicantly better OS in patients with  BMI of  kgm or higher thanin patients with  BMI less than  kgm and evenbetter OS in patients with  BMI of  kgm or higher  ,OS,BMI,1
DiscussionOur retrospective analysis of  patients with lungcancer from  single center demonstrates that patientswith  BMI of  kgm or higher who are classied asobese experience OS superior to that of patients with aBMI considered healthy  kgm,BMI,OS,1
These results are consistent with the previous reports evaluating the role of BMI in OS in advancedNSCLC as well as in surgically resected lung cancer,BMI,OS,1
 They analyzed OS for  patients on the basisof their BMI and found that within the rst  monthspatients with  BMI in the obese range experiencedsurvival superior to that of nonobese patients HR ,OS,BMI,1
 As in our study theauthors observed signicantly improved OS in patientswith  BMI of  kgm or higher as compared with inpatients with  BMI less than  kgm,OS,BMI,1

 The phosphorylation of Erk STAT and related signaling molecules were induced activated after FUZ overexpression,STAT3,FUZ,1
 Loss of FUZ resulted in decreased BNIP protein level but no inuence on BNIP mRNA level suggesting weakened stability of BNIP protein,FUZ,BNIP3,1
 To our knowledge highly activated oncogenes such as myc and STAT  suggest poor prognosis of patient while an increasedlevel of tumor suppressor genes such as p  and PTEN  indicateda better outcome,STAT3,PTEN,1
 As  PCP eector dysregulation of FUZ could result inoveractive PCP signaling pathway followed by subsequent uncontrollable cell division and cellshape changes which suggests FUZ asa potential tumor promoter,PCP,FUZ,1
 Our results indicated that FUZ promotes cell proliferation along with the upregulation of the phosphorylation of Erk and STAT,FUZ,STAT3,1
The FUZ and BNIP cDNA was fused to the GAL binding domainBD pGBKT vector and activation domain AD pGADT vectorrespectively,FUZ,BNIP3,1
 Left NSCLC patients including all subtypes with high FUZ expression showed  signicantly lower OS compared with patients with low FUZ expression   ,FUZ,OS,1
 Patients with high FUZ expression showed  signicantly lower OS compared with patients with low FUZ expression   ,FUZ,OS,1

 FUZ expression activates Erk and STAT signal pathwaysTo further investigate the mechanism responsible for the eect ofFUZ signal pathways involved in cell survival and proliferation wereanalyzed by western blotting,FUZ,STAT3,1
 Whereas phosphorylation of Erkand STAT were inhibited after FUZ knockdown accompanied withdecreased level of Raf and Ras Fig,STAT3,FUZ,1
 FUZ promotes cell proliferation by upregulating phosphorylation of Erk and STAT,FUZ,STAT3,1

 The interaction of FUZ and BNIP was furtherveried by coimmunoprecipitation CoIP Fig,FUZ,BNIP3,1
 FlagFUZ andBNIPhis plasmids were cotransfected in A cells and FUZ clearlycolocalized with BNIP Fig,FUZ,BNIP3,1
 Interestinglyknockdown of endogenous BNIP also resulted in reduced FUZ levelthese results suggested that the interaction of FUZ and BNIP is important for the stability of the two proteins,BNIP3,FUZ,1
 There were signicant alterations in BNIP and FUZ protein levels upon FUZ and BNIPknockdown respectively which indicated posttranslational modications,BNIP3,FUZ,1
 In summary we demonstrated that the interaction of FUZ and BNIP is important for their stability,FUZ,BNIP3,1
 FUZ is  BNIP interacting protein,FUZ,BNIP3,1
 Coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed to prove the interaction of FUZ and BNIP,FUZ,BNIP3,1
 Images showcolocalization of FUZ and BNIP,FUZ,BNIP3,1
 The interaction of FUZ and BNIP is essential for their stability,FUZ,BNIP3,1
 The mRNA levels of FUZ and BNIP were tested by semiquantitative RTPCR,FUZ,BNIP3,1
Investigation of signaling pathways in A and H cells revealed that FUZ overexpression caused dramatic activation of RafRasErk and STAT pathways but little eect on p signals and FUZknockdown resulted in restrained signals,FUZ,STAT3,1
 Our results suggested that FUZ promotes cell proliferation via activating RafRasERK and STAT pathways,FUZ,STAT3,1
 BNIP level isupregulated under the induction of hypoxia and FUZ level is correspondingly induced elevated,BNIP3,FUZ,1

To conrm whether miR induced the inhibition of MMPMMP BCL and CCNE expression mediated by MYB we knockeddown MYB and observed the expression of these genes in lung cancer cells Fig,BCL2,CCNE1,1
 These results showed that knockdown of MYBcould inhibit the expression of BCL and MMP indicating thatmiR reduced BCL and MMP expression at least partiallyvia MYB,BCL2,MYB,1
  The expression level of MYB mRNA in ve NSCLC cell lines was signicantly decreased following transfection with miR which was determined by qRTPCRusing GAPDH as an internal control,MYB,GAPDH,1
  The protein level of MYB was decreased in ve NSCLC cell lines when transfected with miR with GAPDH as  loading control,MYB,GAPDH,1
  Overexpression of miR by miR mimics decreased the MYB protein level andsubsequently reduced the expression of BCL and CCNE but did not affect CCNB expression as determined using western blotting analyses,MYB,BCL2,1
 Knockdown of MYB expression by siMYB decreased MYB BCL and MMPprotein levels but did not have any effect on MMP and CCNE,MYB,BCL2,1
 In addition the luciferase report assay conrmedMYB CCNE and WEE as candidates,CCNE1,WEE1,1
  The expression of MYB was determined using realtime PCR in  paired human NSCLC tissues and normalised against GAPDH,MYB,GAPDH,1

 We found that miR downregulated itssubstrate UBEC through direct interaction with its UTR andUBEC directly binds to the promoter of ABCG and ERCC to regulate their transcriptional activity,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 Therefore the miRUBECABCGERCC axis reverses cisplatin resistance via downregulation of drug resistant genes of ABCG and ERCC in DDPresistant NSCLC cells,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
Therefore lung cancer patients overexpressing ABCG and ERCC arepotentially tolerant to DDP and result in failure of using DDP therebyincreasing the mortality rate of lung cancer,ABCG2,ERCC1,1

  The mRNA and protein levels ofmiR UBEC ABCG and ERCC were analyzed by RTPCR Western blot  and immunohistochemical staining  assay in the DDP resistant lung cancer tissues and their nonresistant tissues with anthracyclinesbased neoadjuvant chemotherapy,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 miR reverses DDP resistance by downregulating drug resistancegenes ABCG and ERCC in DDPresistant NSCLC cellsTo determine whether miR is associated with DDP resistance inlung cancer cells we performed RTPCR assay and found that miRlevels were lower in DDPresistant NSCLC cells ADDP HDDP and CaluDDP than in their parent cells indicating that miR signicantly contributes to DDP resistance in DDPresistant NSCLCcells Fig,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 However miR only regulated ABCG and ERCC Fig,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 ThemRNA and protein levels of ABCG and ERCC were measured  hafter transfection with miR mimics and miR inhibitors,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
ABCG and ERCC mRNAs and proteins were signicantly downregulated after miR overexpression,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 Moreover miR reduced the mRNA and protein levels of ABCG and ERCC in  dose and timedependentmanner in ADDP and HDDP cells Fig,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 Collectivelythese data indicated that miR reverses DDP resistance by downregulating drug resistance genes ABCG and ERCC in DDPresistant NSCLCcells,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 However miR did not directly bind to the  untranslated region of ABCG and ERCC by crosslinkingligation and sequencing of hybrids assay data not to shown,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 miR reverses DDP resistance by downregulating drug resistance genes ABCG and ERCC in DDPresistant NSCLC cells,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 The mRNA and protein levels of miR ERCC and ABCG were analyzed were analyzed by RTPCR and immunoblotting,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
 RTPCR and Western blot result shows that miR dosedependently and timedependently decreased the mRNA andprotein levels of ERCC and ABCG,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
 UBEC directly binds to the promoter of ABCG and ERCC to regulatetheir transcriptional activity result in DDP resistanceTo further investigate the relationship between UBEC and the DDPresistance in NSCLC,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 S  UBEC only regulates ABCG and ERCC,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 Therefore DDP resistance is closely associated with the expression of drugresistance genesincluding ERCC and ABCG in the DDP resistant NSCLC cells,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
 MoreoverALGGEN and JASPAR analysis predicted the binding site in the  untranslated region UTR of ABCG and ERCC,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 UBEC may directly target ABCG and ERCC,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 To conrm the interaction between UBEC andABCGERCC we further identied the promoter core region inABCG and ERCC,UBE2C,ERCC1,1
 Similarly the region  of ERCC promoter may activate ERCC promoter mediated by UBEC Fig,ERCC1,UBE2C,1
 Therefore UBEC directly targetsthe ABCG promoter Fig,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
These data indicate that UBEC upregulates ABCG and ERCC by directly targeting their UTR region,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 The mRNA and protein levels of ERCC and ABCGwere increased in A cells overexpressing UBEC Fig,ERCC1,UBE2C,1
 ERCC and ABCG upregulation byUBEC was conrmed via immunouorescence analysis Fig,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
Moreover UBEC increased ABCG and ERCC mRNA and protein levelsin  dose and timedependent manner in A cells Fig,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 Furthermore ERCC and ABCG transcript and protein levels were signicantlyhigher in ADDP cells than in the parent A cells Fig,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
 The luciferase activity of ABCG and ERCC was also signicantly higher inADDP cells than in A cells thereby contributing to DDP resistance in ADDP cells Fig,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 To further conrm the function ofABCG and ERCC in DDPresistant ADDP cells A cells weretransfected with ABCG or ERCC while ADDP or HDDPcells were transfected with siABCG siABCG and siABCG orsiERCC siERCC and siERCC to detect the proliferation ofthese cells upon treatment with DDP Fig,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
 Knockdown of ABCG or ERCC with siABCG orsiERCC was better Supplementary Fig,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 S  thereforesiABCG or siERCC was only used for the subsequent experimentfor knockdown of ABCG or ERCC,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 The result showed that the cellularproliferation was increased in DDPtreated A cells with the transfection of ABCG or ERCC but decreased in DDPtreated ADDP cellswith knockdown of ABCG or ERCC compared with their control groupsFig,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 Therefore ABCG and ERCC indeed played an important rolein DDPresistant NSCLC cells,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 Moreover UBEC knockdown combinedwith DDP treatment reduced ERCC and ABCG mRNA and proteinlevels as compared to the individual treatments Fig,UBE2C,ERCC1,1
 Spearman rank correlation analysis revealed positive correlations between UBEC and ABCG or ERCCFig,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 UBEC directly binds to the promoter of ABCG and ERCC to regulate their transcriptional activity result in DDP resistance,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
  The activities of pGL    for ABCG and pGL    for ERCC were measured by luciferase reporter gene assays in A cells withtreatment of UBEC,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
  Putative UBEC binding sites in the UTR sequence of ABCG and ERCC,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
  Luciferase activity of ADDP or HDDP cells transfected with plasmidscarrying  wildtype or mutant UTR of ABCG or ERCC in response to overexpress UBEC or knockdown of UBEC using the siRNA,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
  Quantitative ChIP analysis demonstratingthat knockdown of UBEC using the siRNA decreases but overexpressing UBEC increases UBEC levels within the promoter region of ABCG or ERCC in ADDP or HDDPcells,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
   the mRNA and protein levels of ABCG and ERCC were analyzed by RTPCR and Western blotting in A cells with overexpressing UBEC  or in ADDP cells withknockdown of UBEC using the siRNA ,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
  The protein levels of ABCG and ERCC were analyzed by immunouorescent staining assay in A cells with overexpressing UBEC,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
  RTPCR and Western blot result shows that UBEC dosedependently  and timedependently  increased the mRNA and protein levels of ABCG and ERCC in A cells,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 RTPCR and western blot assay showed the mRNA and protein levels of ERCC and ABCG were dramatically higher in ADDP than its parent cell A,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
  The luciferaseactivity of the ERCC and ABCG promoter was higher in the ADDP cells compared with its parent cell A by luciferase reporter assay,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
   A cells were transfected withABCG and ERCC or ADDP cells were knockdown of ABCG and ERCC using siRNA then these cells were treated with DDP at  gml for  ,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
  RTPCR and western blot assay showed that cotreatment with siUBECand DDP signicantly reduced the mRNA and protein levels of drug resistant genes ERCC and ABCG than individual treatment of siUBEC or DDP in ADDP cells respectively,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
 luciferase reporter assay showed that the luciferase activity of the ERCC and ABCG promoter was lower in the ADDP cells with cotreatment with siUBEC and DDP thanindividual treatment of siUBEC or DDP respectively,ERCC1,ABCG2,1
 These results indicate that UBEC modulatesDDP resistance via regulation of antidrug genes ABCG and ERCC inNSCLC,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 miR reverses DDP resistance by regulating ABCG and ERCC bydirectly targeting UBECmiR inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation apoptosis migration invasion and EMT which reversed DDP resistance via regulation of ABCG and ERCC Figs,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 Moreover miR did notdirectly bind to the UTR of ABCG and ERCC Fig,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
  andUBEC directly bound to the UTR of ABCG and ERCC Fig,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
Therefore we hypothesized that miR reverses DDP resistancevia regulation of ABCG and ERCC by directly targeting UBECand these molecules participate in the miRUBECABCGERCC axis to reverse DDP resistance in DDPresistant NSCLC cells,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
To investigate this hypothesis we separately transfected miRmimics or miR inhibitors into ADDP cell lines and performed WB to detect ABCG and ERCC in these cells,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 These data indicate that miR downregulated ABCG and ERCC via regulationof UBEC,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 However our results showed that these effects remained almost unchanged inADDP cells with cotransfection of miR mimics andsiUBEC upon treatment of DDP compared with treatment of PBSthe mRNA and protein levels of ABCG and ERCC Fig,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
 These data indicate that UBEC mediated miR reverses DDP resistance via regulation of ABCG and ERCC,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 miR inhibits DDPresistant tumor growth in vivoBased on the aforementioned function of miR and UBEC incisplatin resistance miR directly bound to the UTR of UBECand UBEC directly bound to the UTR of ABCG and ERCC we believe that miR should play  much more important role in themiRUBECABCGERCC axis to reverse DDP resistance,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
 miR reverses DDP resistance by regulating ABCG and ERCC by directly targeting UBEC,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
  The mRNA and protein levels of miR UBEC ABCG and ERCC were analyzed by RTPCR and Western blot assay,ABCG2,ERCC1,1
For instance expression of UBEC is required for the destruction of mitotic cyclins such as cyclin  to promote cell cycle progression from Mto G phase UBEC expression was accompanied by that of other biomarkers such as prolactininducible protein AZGP and SA orwith pituitary tumortransforming  PTTG Survivin and thymidinkinase  which might improve the prediction of outcomes in humancancer ,UBE2C,S100A8,1
 Moreover our data indicated that UBEC serves as  transcription factor for antidrug genesABCG and ERCC to induce cisplatin resistance in lung cancer whichdoes not occur via the proteasome pathway,UBE2C,ERCC1,1
 UBEC directly bound to the UTR of ABCG and ERCC to increase the expression of these antidrug genes,UBE2C,ABCG2,1
Therefore miR reverses DDP resistance via regulation of ABCGand ERCC by directly target of UBEC,ERCC1,UBE2C,1

 Collectively these results suggest thatselective EGFR TKIs by blocking the further transformation and proliferation of EGFR positive preneoplastic lesions inhibiting angiogenesis and MMP synthesiscombined with selective COX inhibitors which inhibitlung carcinogenesis angiogenesis and tumour invasionand restore CMIs may prove particularly effective inpreventing the development of second primary malignancies in patients who have had potentially curativesurgery for NSCLC or cancer of the head and neck,EGFR,MMP,1

  For  example  cancerspecic  splicingisoforms  of  certain  genes  such  as  CD    BCL  like    BCLL  and  tumor  protein  p  TP     are  reported  to  promotetumor  progression,CD44,BCL2,1
  In  addition  to  the  typical  TP  protein  P  the  TP  genealso  produces  TP  through  AS  of  intron    resultingin  protein  isoforms  with  different  carboxylterminal  domains  Fig,TP53,AS,1
  Chromatin  immunoprecipitation  analysis  demonstratedthat  different  TP  isoforms  have  distinct  preferences  in  binding  todifferent  target  promoters    TP  preferentially  binds  preferably  to  the  MDM   protooncogene  Mdm  promoter  but  poorly  tothe  BCL  associated    Bax  promoter    whereas  TP  tends  tobind  more  tightly  to  the  Bax  promoter  but  poorly  to  the  Mdmpromoter,TP53,MDM2,1

   The   enhancement   of  ROS   generation   in   H   and   H   getinibresistant   NSCLCcells   leads   to  impairment   of   growth   and   induction   of  apoptosis   whereas   modulation   of   EGFR   degradation   and   its   downstream   signalling   pathways   by   Shikonin   contributes   to  its   antitumour   properties   inH   getinibresistant   NSCLC   cells   with   TM   and   LR   activating   mutations,ROS,EGFR,1
  Our  previous  study  demonstratedthat  sanguinarine  an  active  component  of    Chinese  medicinalherb  CMH  elevates  ROS  and  triggers  specic  EGFR  degradation  and  cell  death  in  getinibresistant  NSCLC  cells  ,ROS,EGFR,1
  Additionally  the  phosphorylation  levelof  midstream  AKT  and  ERK  signalling  proteins  in  H  andH  getinibresistant  cancer  cells  was  signicantly  decreasedby  Shikonin  treatment  Fig,AKT,ERK,1
  Hand  H  getinibresistant  cells  were  treated  with  Shikonin  andNAC  alone  or  in  combination  for      and  AKT  and  ERK  Fig,AKT,ERK,1
  Shikonin  effectively  induces  EGFR  degradation  andsuppresses  the  EGFR  signalling  pathway  in  H  cellsInhibiting  ROS  using  NAC  and  MG    proteasomal  degradation  pathway  inhibitor  completely  blocked  the  EGFR  degradationof  H  and  H  cells  after  Shikonin  treatment  alone  or  cotreatment  with  Shikonin  and  NAC,EGFR,ROS,1
  A  and    indicating  thatincreased  ROS  is  essential  for  Shikonininduced  apoptosis  in  Hcells  and  that  the  apoptotic  effect  is  dependent  on  the  EGFR  proteasomal  degradation  pathway,ROS,EGFR,1

  In  the  present  study  Shikonin  also  signicantlyinduced  apoptosis  in  H  and  H  getinibresistant  NSCLCcells  accompanied  by  increases  in  AKT  ERK  and  Bcl  family  member  degradation  which  are  initiators  or  executors  of  apoptotic  celldeath  that  lead  to  caspase  activation  and  subsequent  cleavageof  PARP,ERK,PARP,1
  ROS  overproduction  also  triggers  EGFR  degradation   resulting  in  inhibition  of  EGFR  downstream  antiapoptotic  and  growth  proliferation  signalling,ROS,EGFR,1
  ROS  overproduction  induces  DNA  damage  and  triggers  mitochondrialdysfunction  resulting  in  activation  of  caspasedependent  apoptosis,ROS,DNA,1
Additionally  this  apoptotic  effect  is  due  to  induction  of  EGFRdegradation  by  ROS  generation  which  is  mediated  by  activation  ofthe  cblmediated  proteasomal  degradation  pathway  and  results  inEGFR  degradation  and  suppression  of  EGFR  proliferation  and  antiapoptotic  signalling,ROS,EGFR,1

 This has led to molecular characterization of mechanisms of acquired resistance and the clinical use of ALK and ROS inhibitors with expanded mechanisms of action such as LDK,ALK,ROS,1
 Small molecule  inhibitors  of  FGFR  are  in  clinical  development and  case report of  NSCLC patient with tumor regression in  response  to  the  FGFR  small  molecule  TKI  BGJ  has FIGURE ,FGFR1,FGFR,1
For  patients  with  lung  adenocarcinoma  the  impact  of genetic  testing  has  led  to  changes  in  the  standard  diagnostic algorithms with recommendations from the International Association  for  the  Study  of  Lung  Cancer  and  National Comprehensive  Cancer  Network that  newly  diagnosed patients with advanced disease be tested for EGFR mutation and ALK fusion testing,EGFR,ALK,1
 In addition many institutions are now routinely testing for alterations in genes such as ROS RET MET protooncogene MET BRAF and HER which have shown initial promise in tailored cancer treatment,MET,HER2,1
The  need  to  perform  detailed  molecular  testing  of  lung cancers began with the correlation of EGFR mutations and sensitivity to gefitinib and erlotinib in lung adenocarcinoma typically in patients with modest tobacco exposure EGFR TK inhibitors TKIs are now the established firstline therapy in patients with NSCLC  known  to  have  activating  mutations  in  EGFR,EGFR,TK,1
 In addition  number of different mutations have been identified in FGFR and FGFR including  recurrent  fusion  of  FGFR  and  transforming  acidic  coiledcoil containing protein  TACC which provides much needed insight  into  the  oncogenic  pathways  operating  in  SCC  and makes  strong case for applying FGFR inhibitors in this disease,FGFR2,FGFR3,1
 These aberrations  include  genetic  alterations  affecting  histonemodifying enzymes CREB binding protein CREBBp EA binding protein p Ep and LFF as well as pTEN mutations FGFR and SOX amplification,CREB,FGFR1,1
 For example inhibition  of  the  histone  demethylase  KDMA  has  been  shown to preferentially eliminate clonogenic survivors to EGFR TK therapy in EGFRmutant NSCLC cell lines,KDM5A,EGFR,1
 Conversely the EGFR wildtype patients showed that frontline EGFR TKI was  harmful strategy for them with HR of ,EGFR,HR,1
 Although the overall  study  was  negative  the  subgroup  analysis  of  EGFR mutants  suggested  that  erlotinib  provided    DFS  advantage with HR of ,EGFR,HR,1
  more definitive prospective randomized trial including only EGFR mutants and powered to examine OS is set to begin this year,EGFR,OS,1
HERPOSTIVE NSCLCThe Role of HER and HER in NSCLCHER and HER also known as ERBB and ERBB respectively  are  members  of  the  HERERBB  RTK  family which also includes EGFR and HER,HER2,ERBB2,1
 For example HER has no known highaffinity ligand and therefore uses homo or heterodimerization for activation and HER has no TK activity and relies on heterodimerization to induce downstream signaling,HER2,TK,1
 However HER has been implicated as an escape mechanism for drugs that inhibit signaling through EGFR and HER,EGFR,HER2,1
 Although  HER  mutations  are  relatively  rare  in  lung cancer the rate of detection can be enriched by testing neversmoker patients with adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous histology without an EGFR mutation in which case the frequency is approximately ,HER2,EGFR,1
 HER mutations are mutually exclusive with point mutations in EGFR KRAS BRAF neuroblastoma RAS viral ras oncogene homolog NRAS PIKCA MEK and AKT as well as rearrangements in ALK,HER2,RAS,1
AfatinibAfatinib  is  an  irreversible  small  molecular  inhibitor  of  EGFR and  HER  that  is  approved  for  use  in  the  firstline  setting  for patients  with  EGFRmutant  NSCLC,EGFR,HER2,1
  In  lung  cancer  cell  lines harboring  HER insertion mutation in the TK domain afatinib was effective at inhibiting survival whereas erlotinib was not,HER2,TK,1
 In the clinic this phenomenon  underlies  the  marked  responsiveness  of  ALKpositive tumors  to  small  molecule ALK TK  inhibition,ALK,TK,1
  Crizotinib   multitargeted  TKI  of ALK  ROS  and  cMET  was  the  first ALK  inhibitor  tested  in  the  clinic  and  helped  to  establish ALK as  therapeutic target in NSCLC,ROS1,ALK,1
 This issue has similarly complicated the analysis of OS in multiple randomized phase III studies of EGFR TKIs in advanced  EGFRmutant  NSCLC,OS,EGFR,1
NextGeneration ALK Inhibitors Alectinib and CeritinibAlectinib RO is  highly potent and selective TKI targeting ALK but not ROS or cMET,ALK,ROS1,1
 In preclinical studies ceritinib is also more potent and selective than crizotinib targeting ALK and ROS  but  not  cMET,ALK,ROS1,1

the most frequent comutation occurring in over  of patients withmultiple mutations specically in  of KRAS positive tumors withcomutations and  of EGFR sensitizing mutation positive tumorswith comutations Supplemental Fig,KRAS,EGFR,1
However no OS dierence was seen in either KRAS group Fig,OS,KRAS,1
 We further assessed whether KRAS and TP comutationsspecically conferred any additional prognostic value through multivariate analysis,KRAS,TP53,1
 EGFR mutations were not signicantly associated with OS in either the entire cohort or in patientswith adenocarcinomas Fig,EGFR,OS,1
 Furthermore patients with TP mutations either alone orwith  comutation had signicantly worse OS than patients with mutation HR  ,TP53,OS,1
 Patients with either EGFR or TP mutations had signicantlyworse DFS than patients who lacked these mutations HR  ,EGFR,TP53,1
 There were no signicant dierences eitherin OS or DFS between patients with and without KRAS mutationsFig,OS,KRAS,1
 These results concur with the results of the recentlypublished LACEBio analyses that reported the absence of signicantprognostic eect of comutations of TP KRAS and EGFR on overallsurvival ,KRAS,EGFR,1
 OS was not signicantly dierent between the groups which potentially may be explained by the subsequent use of targeted EGFR inhibitors upon relapse,OS,EGFR,1
 KRAS mutations were associated with worse DFS but not OS on univariate analysis,KRAS,OS,1

 However other studies including arecent metaanalysis of  studies have shown that KRAS mutation waspredictive for worse OS and PFS in early stage NSCLC ,KRAS,OS,1
 Interestinglywhile KRAS mutations alone showed no OS dierence on multivariateanalysis the addition of TP mutations did lead to  worse OS ascompared to no mutations,KRAS,OS,1
 This however seems to be due more to theeect of TP than KRAS mutations,TP53,KRAS,1
 The LACEBio group reported nosignicant prognostic eect of KRAS and TP comutations but theydid not look at other KRAS comutation subgroups nor did they look ata no mutations group,KRAS,TP53,1
 In both univariateand multivariate analysis single TP mutation was associated withworse DFS and worse OS,TP53,OS,1
Our data seem to contradict several studies regarding the prognosticroles of EGFR KRAS and TP mutations including our own publishedreports JBR,KRAS,TP53,1
 Previously EGFR and KRAS negative tumours were dened by the absence of these driver mutations,EGFR,KRAS,1
 Certain driver mutations such as EGFR MET and BRAF wereseen as early event clonal mutations whereas PIKCA and KRAS wereconsidered late subclonal events,BRAF,PIK3CA,1

 In an effort to prole the expression pattern of COMMD family in several nonsmall cell lung cancer NSCLC cell lines we foundthat compared with that in human bronchial epithelial HBE cells the mRNA expression levels of veCOMMD genes including COMMD COMMD COMMD COMMD and COMMD were signicantly downregulated whereas COMMD was upregulated in NSCLC cell lines,COMMD,COMMD6,1
 Mechanistically COMMD interacted with the TFDP through COMM domainand DNAbinding domain of TFDP was required for this interaction,COMMD9,TFDP1,1
 In addition it was shown that COMMD andother COMMD family members interact with and regulate the activationof  particularly prolic group of ubiquitin ligases known as CullinRINGligases CRLs ,COMMD1,COMMD,1
 TFDP and EF contain hydrophobic heptad repeats which are believed to be involved in heterodimer formation through coilcoil interaction,TFDP1,E2F1,1
 Though TFDP by itselfhas very little transcriptional activity it cooperates with the EF to activate transcription of the downstream target genes ,TFDP1,E2F1,1
 MoreoverCOMMD interacted with TFDP through COMM domain and decreased expression COMMD attenuated TFDPEF activation accompanied with enhanced p signaling pathway,TFDP1,COMMD9,1
 These ndings highlightthe function of COMMD and the control of TFDPEF transcriptionalactivity through COMMD family member for the rst time,COMMD9,COMMD,1

 Plasmids and siRNAExpression vectors for COMMD TFDP LC and COMMD weregenerated by PCR amplication from cDNA template using PhantaMax SuperFidelity DNA Polymerase Vazyme Pd,COMMD8,DNA,1
 COMMD is overexpressed in nonsmall cell lung cancerIn an effort to prole the expression pattern of COMMD gene familyin NSCLC cell lines we selected four NSCLC cell lines including AH SPCA and H,COMMD9,COMMD,1
 Comparing with that in HBEcells the mRNA expression of several COMMD genes includingCOMMD COMMD COMMD COMMD and COMMD was downregulated COMMD was upregulated whereas COMMD COMMDand COMMD had no consistent change in NSCLC cell lines Fig,COMMD,COMMD6,1
  COMMD mRNA expression level was analyzed by PCR in four NSCLC celllines and HBE cells,COMMD9,HBE,1
  The protein expression level of COMMD was detected by western blot in four NSCLC cell lines and HBE cell line,COMMD9,HBE,1
 However knocking down of COMMD had no obviouseffect on the cell cycle of HBE cells this could explain why knockingdown of COMMD had less inhibitory effects on the growth of HBEcells because had no effects on cell cycle,COMMD9,HBE,1
 A the uorescence pattern of LCPrevious study has indicated that TFDP may be an interacting protein in tandem afnity purication screens using COMMD as bait ,TFDP1,COMMD9,1
To conrm this result we conducted an immunoprecipitationwesternblot assay and found that COMMD bound with TFDP in HEK Tcells Fig,COMMD9,TFDP1,1
 To elucidate which domains were essential for the interaction between COMMD and TFDP we constructed  panel of deletion mutants of COMMD and TFDP according to the previousreports Fig,COMMD9,TFDP1,1
 Using  similar approach it was found that COMMD couldalso interact with TFDP Fig,COMMD8,TFDP1,1
 Further using deletion mutants ofTFDP we determined the critical region in TFDP required for interaction with COMMD,TFDP1,COMMD9,1
 We further examined several TFDPEF regulated genes expression andfound that CDC CCNA CCNE CCNE and CDCA were down regulated in COMMD siRNAs transfected A cells Fig,CCNE2,CDC25A,1
 COMMD interacts with TFDP,COMMD9,TFDP1,1

  HEK T cells were transfected with vectors encoding HAtagged COMMD and either Vtagged wild type WT or deletionmutants of TFDP,COMMD9,TFDP1,1
 The mRNA expression levels of TFDPEF regulated genes CDC CCNA CCNE CCNE and CDCA were tested by PCR ,CCNE2,CDC25A,1
 The protein expression levels ofp COMMD CDCA and CDCC were checked ,CDC25A,CDC25C,1
 While knocking down COMMD had less effect on cellgrowth and did not affect cell cycle in HBE cells,COMMD9,HBE,1
 It was predicted that TFDP might be the interacting protein of COMMD based on tandem afnity purication ,TFDP1,COMMD9,1
 The COMM domainof COMMD was necessary and sufcient for TFDP binding,COMMD9,TFDP1,1
 In additionwe found that other COMMD protein such as COMMD could also bindwith TFDP,COMMD,COMMD8,1
 Thus we suspect that other COMMD family members could also bind with TFDPand play function similar or opposite to COMMD,COMMD,COMMD9,1
 It iswell known that TFDP transcriptional activity is regulated by interaction with p ARF or SOCS ,TFDP1,ARF,1
 Binding of ARF to TFDP resultsin an inhibition of the interaction between TFDP and EF ,ARF,TFDP1,1
 Whether COMMD could facilitate the dissociation of these repressor proteins from TFDP need to be ascertained,COMMD9,TFDP1,1
 It is suggested that COMMD facilitates TFDPEF transcription activity via interaction with TFDP accompany with attenuated p signaling pathway,COMMD9,TFDP1,1

 In addition the XCR ligand XCL promoted the proliferation andmigration of lung cancer cells markedly and knockdown of XCR by siRNA abolished the effect of XCL incell proliferation and migration,XCR1,XCL1,1
 Furthermore we identied JAKSTAT as  novel downstream pathwayof XCR while XCLXCR increased the mRNA level of the downstream of JAKSTAT including PIMJunB TTP MMP and MMP,MMP2,MMP9,1
 Activation of XCR by its ligand XCL could promote cancer cellproliferation adhesion migration and invasion ,XCR1,XCL1,1
 The antibodies against XCR sc JAK sc JAK  STAT sc and STAT sc wereall purchased from Santa Santa Cruz USA,XCR1,JAK2,1
 To explorethe role of XCR in lung cancer cells we stimulated A and PCcells with different concentrations of XCL    and  nmolfor   and detected the cell proliferation rates by using the MTS,XCR1,XCL1,1
 These results indicated that XCL binding to XCR couldsignicantly increase lung cancer cell proliferation,XCL1,XCR1,1
  A cells were transfected with XCR siRNA and siRNA control and then stimulated with  nmol XCL for  ,XCR1,XCL1,1
Meanwhile knockdown of XCR expression using XCR siRNA inA and PC cells blocked XCR and abolished the role of XCL incell migration Fig,XCR1,XCL1,1
 These results showed that XCL couldpromote lung cancer cell migration by activating XCR,XCL1,XCR1,1
 Further study showed that JAK mRNA level wasslightly evaluated after XCL stimulation Fig,JAK2,XCL1,1
Meanwhile activation of XCR was reported to increase theexpression of matrix metalloproteinase  MMP and MMP inoral cancer cells  which were also regulated by STAT ,XCR1,MMP9,1
We detected the role of XCLXCR in regulating MMP and MMPin lung cancer by qRTPCR and found that XCL upregulated themRNA level of MMP and MMP in  dosedependent manner,MMP2,XCL1,1
Meanwhile knockdown of XCR by siRNA obviously abolished theeffect of XCL in regulating MMP and MMP Fig,XCR1,XCL1,1
By using the western blot assay we further detected the proteinlevel of JAK JAK STAT and STAT in both A and PCcells after XCL stimulation or knockdown of XCR by siRNAFig,STAT3,XCL1,1
 The results showed that no signicant uctuation wasobserved in the expression of JAK and STAT after XCL stimulation,JAK2,STAT3,1
 However we found that XCL signicantly promoted thephosphorylation of JAK and STAT while knockdown of XCRobviously decreased the expression of JAK and STAT,XCL1,JAK2,1
 A and PC cells were cultured with the medium containing   or  nmol XCL for   or knocked down of XCR andcultured with  nmol XCL,XCL1,XCR1,1
 These results suggested  possibleprocedure in NSCLC bone metastasis that XCL in bone tissueactivating XCR in cancer cells promoted tumor progression,XCL1,XCR1,1
 In thisstudy we found that XCL could upregulate PIM JunB and TTPwhile knockdown of XCR abolished the regulation role of XCL inthese oncogenes which indicated that XCLXCR might promoteNSCLC progression by the regulation of PIM JunB and TTP,XCL1,XCR1,1
  reported that activation of the XCLXCRpathway could promote the expression of MMP and MMP in oralcancer cells,MMP2,MMP9,1
 Furthermore MMP and MMP were also consideredas the downstream of JAKSTAT pathway ,MMP2,MMP9,1
 In this study we found that XCLXCR could possibleactivate JAKSTAT pathway which might explain the regulationrole of XCR in MMP and MMP expression,XCR1,MMP2,1
 In addition theregulation of MMP and MMP might also partly explain the role ofoverexpressed XCR in lung cancer bone metastasis,MMP2,MMP9,1

 The most common resistance mechanism is  ThrMet  mutation  in  EGFR  which  increases  the a  nity of the receptor for ATP and allows for continued EGFR  signalling  in  the  presence  of  the  inhibitor,ATP,EGFR,1
  Mechanisms  that  bypass  the requirement for EGFR signalling such as MET and HER ampli cation  could  account  for  another    of resistance to EGFR inhibitors,EGFR,MET,1
  This  was  unlikely  to  be  the  result  of falsenegative  EGFR  testing  because  in  both  cases  the specimens tested were resected tumours and one patient was  reported  to  have    KRAS  mutation,EGFR,KRAS,1
 In adenocarcinoma these  sequencing  e orts  have  resulted  in  the  identi cation of several mutated oncogenic drivers and tumour suppressor genes and have validated the high prevalence of KRAS and EGFR mutations,KRAS,EGFR,1
 In clinical practice the standard of care is to genotype every patient with  new diagnosis  of  metastatic  adenocarcinoma  for  EGFR mutations  and  ALK targeted therapies  are  now  approved  in  cancers  that  have these  abnormalities,EGFR,ALK,1

 Activators of ERK signalling such as EGFR  and  KRAS  are  mutated  more  commonly  in adenocarcinoma,ERK,EGFR,1
 Furthermore in transgenic mice expression of the EGFR LR  mutation  under  the  control  of  the  SPC  promoter led to tumorigenesis which suggests that alveolar type II cells can also serve as the cell of origin of EGFRmutant adenocarcinoma,EGFR,SPC,1
 Transformation from adenocarcinoma to SCLC involves the loss of RB and loss of EGFR protein expression,RB1,EGFR,1
 Furthermore EGFR knockout mice have low expression of SPC  and  have  defects  in  alveolarisation  these  features support    crucial  role  for  EGFR  in  the  development  of alveolar  type  II  cells,EGFR,SPC,1
 When additional key genetic events such as RB inactivation occur these same alveolar type II cells might subsequently transform to SCLC and become independent of EGFR signalling  gure ,RB1,EGFR,1

 These patients are less likely tohave  history of tobacco use compared to MET exon  wild type andKRAS mutation but more than patients with EGFR mutation,MET,EGFR,1
 While ALK rearrangement and EGFR mutation mostly occur inyounger patients age  and  respectively MET exon mutations median age is reported to be  years old in availablestudies ,ALK,EGFR,1
 These promising results strongly suggest theneed of testing for MET exon  mutation in stage IV NSCLC patientsparticularly among those who have already tested negative for othergenetic driver mutations such as EGFR KRAS ALK and ROS,MET,ROS1,1
 Future studies should aim at investigating the prognostic implication of MET exon  in comparisonwith METwildtype and other genomic biomarkers such as EGFRKRAS or ALK,MET,ALK,1

  Crizotinib  was  the  first  ALK  inhibitor  to  be approved  by  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration however it has  very low CSF penetration of  and CSFIC  of    which  explains  the  high  frequency of  CNS  recurrences  that  are  seen  with  crizotinib,ALK,CSF,1
  In    similar  model  using EGFRmutant  PCffluc  cells  Nanjo  and  colleagues showed to  gefitinib  was characterised  by  an  increased  MET  copy  number  with no  ThrMet  mutation  and  the  resistant  tumour responded to  combination of an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib or osimertinib and the MET inhibitor crizotinib,MET,EGFR,1
A  liquid  biopsy  of  the  CSF  is    reliable  method  to determine  the  genetic  characteristics  of  leptomeningeal metastasis  because  circulating  tumour  DNA  from  the CSF represents the genomic alterations of the CNS lesions more accurately than does circulating tumour DNA from plasma,CSF,DNA,1
 Fan and colleagues compared primary tumours mostly  collected  at  diagnosis  with  CSF  liquid  biopsies collected after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment failure from  patients with EGFR mutations and leptomeningeal metastasis from NSCLC,CSF,EGFR,1
  However    ThrMet  mutation  was not the  CSF  when  patients  developed leptomeningeal  metastasis  and  were  resistant  to  EGFR tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  which  supports  previous observations,CSF,EGFR,1
  Jiang  and  colleagues  also showed  lower frequency of EGFR ThrMet mutations and  higher frequency of MET amplification in the CSF than in plasma EGFR ThrMet mutations in only  of samples and MET amplification in ,EGFR,MET,1
and  ThrMet  mutations The different roles of MET copy number gain and EGFR ThrMet mutation in the development of resistance to EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  in leptomeningeal metastasis compared with other sites should be confirmed in future studies,MET,EGFR,1
  If  the  role  of  MET  amplification  is  confirmed studies will be needed to identify the MET inhibitor with the best ability to penetrate the CSF,MET,CSF,1

 Moreover evaluation of CSF circulating tumour  DNA  has  the  potential  to  facilitate  and supplement the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastasis because of the low sensitivity of CSF cytology particularly in  cases  that  cannot  be  detected  by  conventional cytopathological analysis,CSF,DNA,1
 In the osimertinib cohort of the BLOOM study leptomeningeal metastasis was confirmed by positive CSF cytology and EGFRmutated DNA  in  the  CSF,CSF,DNA,1
  Among  the  first    patients  treated EGFRsensitising mutations were detected in the CSF of all patients whereas the EGFR ThrMet mutation was detected in the CSF of two patients and in the plasma of six patients,CSF,EGFR,1
 During treatment two patients showed CSF clearance and six patients had  substantial decrease in their EGFRmutated DNA copies which correlated with improved neurological function or MRI response,CSF,DNA,1
 In  different study that investigated patients  with  EGFR  mutations  that  were  resistant  to gefitinib CSF cytology was positive in only two of seven cases  whereas  EGFRsensitising  mutations  were identified  in  all  seven  patients  moreover  ThrMet mutations were not detected in any cases,EGFR,CSF,1
Evaluation of responsesThe  Response  Assessment  in  NeuroOncology  working group on leptomeningeal metastasis has proposed three basic  elements  to  determine  response  to  treatment   standardised  neurological  examination    CSF  cytology in  all  cancers  or  flow  cytometry  in  haematological cancers  and  radiographic  assessment  with  complete contrastenhanced  neuroaxis  MRI,CSF,MRI,1

 ROS and RET rearrangements resultin formation offusion kinases capable of oncogenic transformation Birchmeier et al,ROS1,RET,1
 These rearrangements seldom occursimultaneously with other genetic alterations such as thosedescribed above for EGFR Ras BRAF and ALK,BRAF,ALK,1
 This nding suggeststhat ROS and RET are independent oncogenic drivers and could bepotential druggable targets Gainor and Shaw  Ju et al,ROS1,RET,1
ROS and RET rearrangements have been identied in  ofNSCLC cases Gainor and Shaw ,ROS1,RET,1
 Patients with ROS rearrangement possess many of the features seen in ALK and EGFRpositive patients,ROS1,ALK,1
 In contrast patients withRET rearrangements have fewer shared features with ALK or EGFRpositive patients than do patients with ROS rearrangementsBergethon et al,ALK,ROS1,1
Since ROS and ALK share  high degree of homology within theirtyrosine kinase domains it is possible to hypothesize that ALKtyrosine kinase inhibitors may also inhibit ROS,ROS1,ALK,1
 Otherrearrangements in RTK such as AXL and NTRK neurotrophictyrosine kinase receptor type  have been discovered but theincidence of these alterations is rare and their clinical importanceunclear Shinh et al,AXL,NTRK1,1

 Specically compound fabrogated the activity of several protein kinases including TGM CDK SK and p MAPK whereascompound c did not have profound effect on the activities of CDK and TGM but instead showedmoderate downregulation of SK activity concomitant with  signicant reduction in p MAPK,CDK9,MAPK,1
 Furtherin silico structural analysis demonstrated that compound f bound slightly better to the ATP binding siteof p MAPK compared to c which correlated well with observed stronger decrement in theexpression level of phosphop MAPK elicited by f in comparison with c,ATP,MAPK,1
 Taking into account thisnding and the abovementioned literature data we propose thatdownregulation of p activity in A induced by compound fcould be associated with abrogation of activities of several kinasesincluding TGM CDK and p MAPK,CDK9,MAPK,1

 When these miRNAs are combined with IR can decrease the survival of NSCLC cells to  higher extent than that exerted by radiationalone and similarly to radiation combined with specific chemical inhibitors of HR and NHEJ repair pathway,HR,NHEJ,1
 Replication Protein  RPA recognizes and binds the  ends thenit is displaced by BRCA allowing binding of RAD and initiation ofrepair by HR,RAD51,HR,1
 RAD loading at sites of DNA damage requires manyfactors including BRCA BRCAFANCD PALBFANCN and theRAD paralogs RADB RADCFANCO RADD XRCC andXRCC and catalyzes the strand capture and invasion of broken endsof DSBs into intact homologous DNA sequences to ensure the fidelity ofthe repair process ,RAD51,DNA,1
 The relationship between DDR genes and radioresistance has long been established nevertheless little is known about the miRNAmediatedregulation of HR and NHEJ pathway during the IRresponse of humannonsmall cell lung cancer NSCLC cells,DDR,HR,1
In the current study we hypothesized that miRNAmediated downregulation of target genes having  central role in HR and NHEJ wouldsensitize NSCLC cells to IR,HR,NHEJ,1
 Before testing the capability of selectedmiRNAs as agents able to promote cellular sensitivity to IR we functionally validated miRNAmRNA interactions involving essential genesof HR RAD BRCA and NHEJ PRKDC XRCC LIG,HR,NHEJ,1
 We chose theTP wild type NSCLC cells A and NCIH  to ascertainthat DDR pathway and DNA repair were not influenced by TP statusthat is commonly mutated in lung cancer ranging from  in adenocarcinomas to  in small cell lung cancers ,DDR,DNA,1
 The contribution of HR and NHEJ repair when eachpathway is chemically inhibited with specific inhibitors has been examined to evaluate the impact of selected miRNAs in DSB repair ofNSCLC cells,HR,NHEJ,1
To specifically inhibit NHEJ or HR pathways A cells were incubated with NU DNAPKcs inhibitor SigmaAldrich RIRAD inhibitor SigmaAldrich or L LIG III and LIG  inhibitorAxon diluted in DMSO at the final concentration of  M for clonogenicassays and  M for DSB repair assay,NHEJ,HR,1
 Genespecific primers for RAD BRCA BRCAPRKDC DNAPKcs XRCC XRCC KU XRCC KU LIGLIG DDB GADDA CDKNA ATM TP and GAPDH are availableat Supplementary Table ,XRCC5,XRCC6,0
 We validated the prelated genes derived from the KEGG pathway analysis by measuringthe expression level of representative genes of such pathway TP andATM according to their central role in this pathway DDB GADDAand CDKNA p known to be radioresponsive genes ,TP53,CDKN1A,1
 B shows that GADDA and CDKNA were fold induced at  hafter IR whereas DDB and ATM were ,GADD45A,CDKN1A,1
 We thus constructed luciferasevectors containing the UTR of BRCA and RAD genes to determinewhether they were direct targets of the two identified miRNAs by insilico analysis,BRCA2,RAD51,1
 As possible IRsensitizing target genes we choseRAD and BRCA of HR pathway and PRKDC XRCC LIG of NHEJ,BRCA2,HR,1
 We tested the interaction between XRCC and hsamiRp that is  potential biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma  andthe interaction between PRKDC and hsamiRp whose expressionlevel is downregulated in NSCLC ,XRCC5,PRKDC,1
 HsamiRp but not hsamiRp reduced significantly the luciferase activity from constructs containingthe LIG UTR and also the PRKDC UTR,LIG1,PRKDC,1
 HsamiRap and hsamiRp decreased significantly the luciferase activity from constructs containing the BRCA and XRCC UTR respectively,BRCA2,XRCC5,1
 The UTRsof target genes RAD BRCA PRKDC DNAPKcs XRCC KU and LIGwere cloned into DualLuciferase Reporter vectors for validation in vivo,PRKDC,XRCC5,1
these results we performed experiments of sitedirected mutagenesis tovalidate that hsamiRp actually targets UTR of RAD gene andhsamiRp targets UTR of PRKDC and LIG genes,RAD51,PRKDC,1
 To evaluate the contribution of HR and NHEJ pathways oncell survival after IR parallel experiments were performed by incubatingthe cells with specific chemical inhibitors of RAD RI DNAPKcsNU and LIGLIG L,HR,NHEJ,1
 DiscussionRadioresistance can occur through efficient repair of DSBs mediatedby HR and NHEJ factors,HR,NHEJ,1
In the current study we analyzed the miRNAmediated regulation ofDSB genes of HR and NHEJ as  strategy to radiosensitize NSCLC TPwild type cells,HR,NHEJ,1
NSCLC A cells activated  pmediated transcriptional response in response to radiation as demonstrated by the psignalingenhancement the induction of GADDA CDKNA and DDB transcripts Fig,CDKN1A,DDB2,1
The DSB repair genes selected for functional validation in this studyare representative of the two essential pathways HR RAD BRCAand NHEJ PRKDC XRCC LIG,HR,NHEJ,1
 RAD and BRCA are required forfilament formation and strand invasion in HR of double strand breakswhereas the DNAdependent protein kinase catalytic subunit DNAPKcs together with KU XRCC and KU XRCC forms the critical DNAPK complex essential for NHEJ,RAD51,BRCA2,1
 Here the functional validation studies with luciferase assays demonstrated that RAD is atarget of hsamiRp BRCA is  target of hsamiRap XRCC isa target of hsamiRp and PRKDC and LIG are targets of hsamiRp Fig,RAD51,BRCA2,1
 Clonogenic survival of irradiated NSCLCA cells treated with miRNA mimics or chemicalinhibitors of HR and NHEJ,HR,NHEJ,1
  RAD PRKDC and LIG genes are real target of miRNA mimics as the activity of constructs containing wild type UTR wassignificantly decreased compared with the mutated UTR,PRKDC,LIG1,1
The results of in vivo biological validation of miRNAmRNA interactions showed that expression of RAD transcript was markedly reduced in cells overexpressing hsamiRp as well as that of PRKDCand LIG transcripts in cells overexpressing hsamiRp Fig,RAD51,LIG1,1
Our results show that overexpression of hsamiRp and hsamiRp had  great impact on the survival of NSCLC A cellsafter irradiation by increasing to  their radiosensitivity similarlyto chemical inhibitors of HR and NHEJ repair,HR,NHEJ,1
 DSB repair efficiency in irradiated cellstreated with HR and NHEJ inhibitors or miRNA mimics,HR,NHEJ,1

 Among  evaluable patients treated with TM inhibitors ORR was not signicantly dierentTP MUT   WT  ,MUT,WT,0

We also assessed the eect of TP status on RFS and OS in the subset ofpatients who received adjuvant chemotherapy     MUT vs WT and identied no signicant dierence in this small subset HR,TP53,OS,1
 When comparing only patients with TP missense mutations    to TP wildtype    OS again was not signicantly dierent HR ,TP53,OS,0
 OS for the subgroup of patients who presented with unresectable stage III or IVdisease    was not inuenced by TP status HR ,OS,TP53,1
 There was  trend toward worse PFS in TP mutated patientswho were on EGFR TKIs median  months for TP mutation compared to ,TP53,EGFR,1
 months for TP wildtype HR ,TP53,HR,1
 However with the introduction of newer next generation sequencing platforms it is nowrecognized that TP is commonly comutated with EGFR,TP53,EGFR,1
We found that in patients with EGFRmutated NSCLC the coexistence of  TP mutation had no inuence on RFS or OS after primarysurgical resection suggesting that comutation is not  strong prognostic marker in untreated patients,TP53,OS,1
 Similarly we could identify nodierence in survival in the subgroup with unresectable disease atAmong the  patients who received EGFR TKIs for treatment ofrecurrent or advanced disease we saw no signicant dierence in ORRbased on TP status ORR  for TP WT and  for TP mutant   ,EGFR,TP53,1

 METAbnormal activation of MET is the second more frequent mechanism of EGFR TKIs resistance Onitsuka et al,MET,EGFR,1
 MET is atyrosine kinase receptor activated by the hepatocyte growth factorHGF which acts through pathways related to PIKAKT RASMAPkinase STAT and NFKb Birchmeier et al,MET,STAT3,1
 MET can also formheterodimers and crossactivate other growth receptorsincludingEGFR and ERBB and has crosstalk with HER ALK and cateninMinuti et al,MET,ALK,1
The deregulation of HGFMET axis can occur in dierent type ofcancer cells at dierent times of cancerogenesis and through dierentmechanisms such as HGF or MET overexpression gene mutations oramplication,HGF,MET,1
 Moreover abnormal activation of MET is associated with resistance to targeted therapies suchas primary and acquired resistance to EGFR TKI in NSCLC but also witha suboptimal response to trastuzumab anti HER Shattuck et al,MET,EGFR,1
Other studies report  range between  and  of MET amplicationin EGFR TKIs resistant patients Arcila et al,MET,EGFR,1
  of cases did not have any increase of MET GCN and theothers had low or intermediate level of GCN,MET,GCN,1
Aberrant activation of MET and intrinsic or acquired resistance toEGFR TKIs may also depend on excessive level of HGF,MET,HGF,1
 Multiple compounds both monoclonal antibodiestargeting HGF or MET and smallmolecules TKIs are in fact still underinvestigation,HGF,MET,1
 Onartuzumab is  humanantibody IgG with murine variable domain which binds MET andcompetes with HGF Merchant et al,MET,HGF,1
 In addition capmatinib has been evaluated in combination with getinib in patients with EGFRmutated NSCLC and acquired MET amplication as  resistance mechanism to EGFR inhibitors in the cohort with MET GCN  the ORR was  Wu et al,MET,EGFR,1
HER amplication represents another mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs,HER2,EGFR,1
identiied  major role for HER in mediating sensitivity and resistanceto EGFR TKIs through the study of preclinical in vitro and in vivo modelsas well as human tissues Takezawa et al,HER2,EGFR,1
 The study also described HER as  possible target in EGFR mutant tumors with acquiredresistance to EGFR TKIs Takezawa et al,HER2,EGFR,1
 Analyzing multiplemodels of acquired resistance the authors demonstrated that levels ofphosphorylated HER decreased after treatment with Afatinib  selective and potent irreversible EGFR and HER inhibitor and that HERwas dephosphorylated in drugsensitive EGFR mutant cells after treatment with Erlotinib Takezawa et al,HER2,EGFR,1
 Additionally they described HER amplication as  new mechanism of acquired resistanceto EGFR TKIs in EGFRmutant NSCLC tumors occurring independentlyof EGFR TM secondary mutation Takezawa et al,HER2,EGFR,1

 First Niederst and colleagues analyzed  EGFR mutantlung adenocarcinoma specimens that underwent transformation intoSCLC demonstrating  loss of RB in all cases Niederst et al,EGFR,RB1,1
Genomesequencing studies of SCLC have previously established thekey role of RB inactivationin SCLCin addition to TP loss,RB1,TP53,1
 As recently reported by Lee and colleagues RB and TP complete inactivation can be detected by immunohistochemistry in the earlystageadenocarcinoma tissues and is predictive of subsequent smallcelltransformation under EGFR TKI treatment representing  cornerstoneof this mechanism of resistance Lee et al,RB1,TP53,1
 When considering thetransformation from adenocarcinoma to SCLC RB and TP lossseems to be necessary but not sucient though,RB1,TP53,1
 When thedierentiation process moves towards adenocarcinoma histology thecombination of EGFR TKI treatment and genetic and epigenetic alterations such as RB loss and EGFR downregulation could switch ittowards  SCLC histotype Oser et al,EGFR,RB1,1
 For instance direct activationof downstream proliferative signaling through MAPK amplicationhas been described as  mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in preclinical EGFRmutant NSCLC models Ercan et al,MAPK1,EGFR,1
Focusing on EGFR the downstreaming signaling pathways whichcan be activated as  EGFR TKI resistance mechanism involve keymediators such as RAS BRAF ERK PTEN AKT and PIKCA,EGFR,AKT,1
 RASRAS proteins are GTPases that include KRAS NRAS and HRAS,NRAS,HRAS,1
 BRAF mutations constitutively activate ERK signaling through hyperactivation of the RASERK pathway resulting inenhanced cell proliferation and survival Brose et al,BRAF,ERK,1
 So far only one study described BRAF mutations as apossible mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs Ohashi et al,BRAF,EGFR,1
 In particular the authors analyzed  NSCLC specimens andfound one case with concurrent EGFR exon deletion and EGFRTM and BRAF VE mutations and another case with EGFRexon deletion and BRAF GA mutation  ,EGFR,BRAF,1
 Most cancer cells harboring  VE BRAF mutation areextremely sensitive to selective BRAF and MEK inhibitors such as Vemurafenib Dabrafenib and Trametinib,BRAF,MEK,1
 MEK and ERKMEK and ERK are protein downstream BRAF in MAPK signalingpathway,MEK,ERK,1
 In preclinical models combination treatment with trametinib  MEK inhibitor and WZ  EGFR inhibitor was able to delay the emergence of EGFR TKI resistance and to enhance WZinducedapoptosis Tricker et al,MEK,EGFR,1
 Firstdocumentation of PIKCA mutations leading to EGFR TKI resistance inNSCLC patients was reported by Sequist et al,PIK3CA,EGFR,1
 They found that signaling corresponding to MET IGF andAXL may be altered but also that SFK may be independent of EGFR,IGF,EGFR,1
Concomitant inhibition of EGFR SFKs and FAK may be an interestingprospective and clinical trials are warranted to explore the combinationof EGFR TKI and STAT and Src inhibitors,EGFR,STAT3,1
 Theactivation of SRC family kinases and focal adhesion kinase with the loss of the amplied mutated EGFR gene contributes to the resistance to afatinib erlotinib andosimertinib in human lung cancer cells,SRC,EGFR,1

 Palbociclib Palbociclib  cell permeable pyridopyrimidine with oral bioavailability serves as  distinctive selective andpromising inhibitor of CDK as well as CDK IC   nM for recombinant proteins ,CDK6,CDK4,1
 Consequently it seemed that afatinib failedto inhibit the function of CDK  in resistant cells which was examined via phosphorylation of RB,CDK,RB,1
 Despite the extended progressionfree survival PFS of reversible EGFRTKIs in comparison with traditional CT in EGFR mutations such as exon  deletion overall survival OS was not promoted,CT,EGFR,1
It is presented in our research that acquired resistance is associatedwith continuous phosphorylation of RB and is readily counteracted viacombination of afatinib with  CDK suppressor,RB,CDK,1
 It was revealed by invitro experiments that cells with both de novo EGFR mutations anddeveloped resistance preserved phosphorylation of RB with afatinibsupplementation,EGFR,RB,1
 ConclusionsIn summary the ndings of our research indicate that acquiredresistance is counteracted via stimulation of RB with the help of CDK  inhibition,RB,CDK,1

 In the same study screening of  EGFR andALK WT adenocarcinomas with reversetranscriptasePCR RTPCR identied two other KIFBRET rearrangements,EGFR,WT,1
The mechanism of activation of RET fusion proteins isanalogous to the oncogenic activation of rearranged ALK inNSCLC but clearly differs from that of ROS,RET,ALK,1
 In the echinoderm microtubule associated protein like  geneEMLALK fusion gene  coiledcoil domain in EML isfused to the ALK kinase domain conferring oligomerizationand constitutive kinase activation whereas coilcoileddomains are not consistently present in ROS fusiongenes in NSCLC and are not necessary to drive oncogenesis,EML4,ALK,1
 Similarly another study showed no signicant differencesbetween RET IHC staining patterns among RETpositiveand RETnegative specimens previously identied byRTPCR and the FN and FP rates by IHC were  and respectively,RET,FN,1
 Furthermore three retrospectiveanalyses conrmed the poor performance of IHC indetecting RET rearrangement with  to  FN and FP results whereas  agreement was demonstrated between WGS FISH and RTPCR,RET,FN,1
Finally NGS WGS and WTS are powerful techniquesto detect different and functional genomic RET variantsby crosschecking of DNA and RNA,RET,DNA,1
 Interestingly NGS hasrecently been applied to detect RET rearrangements inblood samples and KIFBRET fusion gene was successfully identied in cellfree DNA from two of patients with lung adenocarcinoma ,RET,DNA,1
  subsequent retrospective analysis showedthat RETpositive patients with NSCLC had signicantlymore poorly differentiated tumors compared with patients with ALK rearrangement and EGFR mutation,ALK,EGFR,1
Finally some case reports have documented CCDCRET and NCOARET rearrangements in patients withEGFRmutated NSCLC that progressed while they werereceiving EGFR TKIs suggesting that EGFR mutationsand RET fusion genes could coexist and that RET rearrangement could be  potential mechanism of primary oracquired resistance to EGFR inhibition,EGFR,RET,1

Odds ratios OR and  Condence intervals for the odds of high CHFR expression are shown for adenocarcinoma  andtaxane sensitivity in patients with activating EGFR mutations are an attractive and plausible explanation,CHFR,EGFR,1

 CONCLUSIONS We postulate thatthe MYC gene may be implicated in the mechanism of primary resistance to ALK inhibitors,MYC,ALK,1
Several mechanisms of acquired resistance have been reportedincluding secondary mutations within the ALK tyrosine kinasedomain amplification of the ALK fusion gene and the activation ofalternative signaling pathways such as EGFR KIT and insulinlikegrowth factor receptor  ,ALK,KIT,1
Analyzing the case of  patient with primary resistance toCrizotinib we first discovered an amplification of MYC gene andthen studied it in vitro as potential new mechanism of primaryresistance to ALK inhibition,MYC,ALK,1
 BreakApart FISH for ALK and FISH for MYC carried out on pretreatment diagnostic tumor biopsy and on pleural fluid tumor cellsat the time of disease progression showing ALK rearrangement in N of tumor cells upper panels and MYC amplification GCN  inboth pretreatment tumor biopsy and rebiopsy at disease progression lower panels,ALK,MYC,0
PreClinical ValidationIn order to confirm the possible pathogenetic role of MYCamplification in conferring primary resistance to ALK inhibitorshuman EMLALK rearranged H cells were infected with thelentiviral transfer vector pLentimGFPPAPuroOrigene RockvilleMD carrying full length human MYC cDNA as previously described,ALK,MYC,1
These results indicate MYC overexpression as  potential mechanismassociated with resistance to specific ALK inhibitors,MYC,ALK,1
DiscussionDiverse mechanisms of acquired secondaryresistance toALKinhibitors in ALKrearranged NSCLC have been describedincluding ALKdependent ones such as TK domain mutations oramplification of ALK gene and ALKindependent ones such asEGFR MET and PIK mutations or amplifications which activatebypass signaling pathways ,TK,ALK,1
In our case the presence of ALK rearrangement together withMYC amplification has been confirmed with different techniquesFISH and NGS in different tissue samples baseline tumor cytologyrecurrent tumor cytology and CTCs suggesting  role for MYC inthe innate resistance to Crizotinib,ALK,MYC,1
 Hence our data are in keeping with theobservation made in  recent study carried out with  whole genomeshorthairpin shRNA screen in ALK rearranged lung cancer celllines indicating MYC binding protein as  determinant of crizotinibsensitivity ,ALK,MYC,1

 Several clinical studies have highlighted ROS as  promising therapeutic target because crizotinib multitargeted drug against ROS ALK and the MET protooncogene has elicited remarkable responsesin ROSrearrangements NSCLC,ROS1,MET,1
 Here we demonstrate that D culture with gellan gum can restore the ROSoncogene dependence of HCC cells by upregulating the expression of the ROS fusion gene andreducing the activity of the EGFR pathway,ROS1,EGFR,1
 Further sequencing analysis of NSCLCtumors elucidated the presence of several partner genes fused withROS including CD e EZR e SLCA and SDC  ,CD74,EZR,1
 Clinical studies of next generation tyrosine kinase inhibitorsTKI against ROS are ongoing including lorlatinib cabozantinibentrectinib brigatinib ceritinib DSb and TPX some ofwhich also inhibit ALK because of its high homology with ROSspecically  amino acid sequence identity in the kinase domainand  identity in the adenosine triphosphate ATP binding region ,ROS1,ALK,1
In the current study we determined that FCeM medium anRPMI and Ham F based medium containing gellan gumrestored the ROS dependence of HCC cells,F12,ROS1,1
 As  mM getinib and  nM afatinib will prevent phosphorylation not only of EGFR but also other ERBB family memberswe conducted combination treatment of crizotinib with andwithout cetuximab to further investigate the specic inhibition ofEGFR,EGFR,ERBB,0
Although MET phosphorylation was observed in HCC cells in aprevious study addition of the MET inhibitor PHA did notreduce the IC of HCC to ROS inhibitors Fig,MET,ROS1,1
 Thus these data suggested the signaling from ERBB familykinases including EGFR but not MET contribute to the resistanceof HCC cells to ROS inhibitors,ERBB,ROS1,1
Consistent with the data western blot analysis showed that in theattached culture condition phosphorylation of AKT and ERKwas reactivated after   of crizotinib treatment even thoughphosphorylation of ROS was still suppressed in  dosedependentmanner Fig,AKT,ROS1,1
 After changing the medium to  D FCeM culture condition we observed decreasing phosphorylation of EGFR and itsdownstream modulators AKT and ERK as well as increasedSLCA and SLCAROS expression and phosphorylationFig,EGFR,AKT,1
 BeC we found that mRNA expression of SLCAROSendogenous SLCA exex as well as the ROS kinase regionexex but not the nonfusion region of ROS exex werenotably increased in FCeM medium Fig,SLC34A2,ROS1,1
These results suggested that activation of the ERBB family pathwaypartially contributes to the resistance of HCC cells to ROS inhibitors,ERBB,ROS1,1
 Consistent with theseobservations the ICs of crizotinib to HCCxe cells expressingROS WT and D  were fold and twofold less whereas theIC to HCCxe ROS GR exceeded the peak plasma levelFig,WT,ROS1,1
Finally to extend the in vitro observation to in vivo conditionswe conrmed that HCCxe ROS WT cells were sensitive tocrizotinib but HCCxe cells expressing ROS D  andGR mutations tended to moderately and completely resistantto crizotinib in vivo,ROS1,WT,1
 In the future the therapeutic strategy with ROS positivepatients is expected to be similar to that for ALK positive patientsand our D assay system using HCC in FCeM medium will be auseful model to evaluate ROS mutations and screen inhibitors,ROS1,ALK,1

 PCR and western blot analysisrevealed that ZIC expression was closely associated with CCNB and CDK complex expression whileother cell cyclerelated genes showed no signicant correlation with ZIC,ZIC5,CCNB1,1
Conclusions Our experiment show that ZIC is highly upregulated in NSCLC tumor tissues and suggestthat ZIC may act as an oncogene by inuencing CCNB and CDK complex expression,ZIC5,CCNB1,1
 ZIC was  transcription factor whichbelong to the ZIC family which was involved in various human solidtumors,ZIC5,ZIC,1
 KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that ZIC expression was highly correlated with genes enriched in the cell cycle mismatch repair and DNA replication,ZIC5,DNA,1
After knocking down ZIC the expression levels of CCNB and CdcC were dramatically decreased while the expression levels of p p CCNA CDK were not signicantlyaltered,CCNB1,CDK1,1

RRM is crucial for the nucleotide excision repair system of DNA damage removal pathway ,RRM1,DNA,1
 In thepresent metaanalysis vast majority of the included studies used gemcitabine and carboplatin andor cisplatin and we noticed signicantdierence in OS between low RRM group and high RRM group butthere was no signicant dierence between the groups in PFS,OS,RRM1,1
We have found that ECOGPS zero score was inversely associatedwith OS and PFS and positively associated with HR in overall as well asin low and high RRM subgroup analyses,OS,HR,1
 On the other hand ECOGPSone score was positively associated with OS and PFS and inversely associated with HR in overall as well as in low and high RRM subgroupanalyses,OS,HR,1
 Among the authorswho used low RRM expression as reference HR   not all foundoutcomes over  or under  HR,RRM1,HR,0
 Because HR is standardized outcomemeasure which eliminates the variabilities in individual study cutosused for RRM therefore it is reasonable to suggest that at least in thispopulation of NSCLC patients RRM may not be  good prognostic,HR,RRM1,1
 Statistical heterogeneity was high in metaanalyses evaluating the eect of RRM expression of OS and PFS which could have impact on the credibility ofoutcomes,RRM1,OS,1
 ConclusionPooling of  HR data revealed no meaningful association betweenthe expression of RRM or its magnitude,HR,RRM1,1
 Overall survivalhowever favored the prognostic role of RRM in NSCLC as OS wassignicantly longer in low RRM expression group than in high RRMexpression group,RRM1,OS,1

Materials and methods The activation of IGFR signaling was assessed by the phosphorylation of IGFR and itsdownstream target AKT using immunoblot,IGF1R,AKT,1
 BMS inhibits DGinduced IGFR phosphorylationWe previously demonstrated that DG treatment activates the prosurvival AKT pathway independently of glycolysis inhibition ,IGF1R,AKT,1
 DGinduced IGFR phosphorylation at these siteshowever was observed by Estan et al in leukemia cell lines who alsoobserved  serumdependent DG induction of AKT phosphorylation aswe reported previously ,IGF1R,AKT,1
 Our analysis indicated that DGinduced IGFRphosphorylation can be reliably detected by antiphosphoTyr antibody cat in EKVX cells within  min even though themagnitude of IGFR phosphorylation induced by  mM DG wasweaker than that by  ngml IGF Fig,IGF1R,IGF1,1
 DGinduced AKT phosphorylation was not observed at  min consistent with our hypothesis that DGinduced IGFR phosphorylationprecedes AKT phosphorylation,AKT,IGF1R,1
 DGinduced IGFR phosphorylationand AKT phosphorylation were also observed in H and H NSCLCcell lines Fig,IGF1R,AKT,1
 Furthermore BMS  clinical grade IGFR inhibitorcompletely inhibited DGinduced IGFR and AKT phosphorylation inall three cell lines Fig,IGF1R,AKT,1
 These data support our previous ndingthat DG is capable of activating AKT signaling through IGFR inNSCLC cell lines,AKT,IGF1R,1
 In these MEF isogeniccells reestablishment of LKBAMPK signaling was also capable ofsuppressing caspase and PARP cleavage induced by the combinationof DG and BMS Fig,MEF,PARP,1
 In contrast the PIKCA somatic mutation ratealone in invasive breast carcinoma is  and the rate of PTEN inactivation mutation is ,PIK3CA,PTEN,1
 As  result these cell lines are likely tohave high baseline AKT activity and it is unclear whether DGinduced IGFR phosphorylation can cause sucient change in AKTphosphorylation to promote cell survival,AKT,IGF1R,1

 Despite thepooled unadjusted HRs from univariate analysis revealed no statistically signicance the pooled adjusted HR suggested  signicantsurvival benet among patients with ESR mRNA expression,HR,ESR1,1
The heterogeneity in the association of ESR and OS could bepartially explained by disease stages and it indicates that favorablesurvival benets may be more prominent in patients of theadvanced stage,ESR1,OS,1
 There were anumber of studies employed the IHC method to explore the prognostic role of ESR in lung cancer survival and these studies were categorized by location of expression nuclear or cytoplasm howeveraccording to  recent qualitative systematic review on the IHCmethod contradictive results obtained from insufcient numberof studies made it hard to evaluate the virtual prognostic roles ofeither ESR cytoplasm or nuclear expression in NSCLC survival,ESR,ESR1,1

 Weobserved fully concordant results with single ALK and ROS FISH tests,ALK,ROS1,1
 Searching for targetable ALK and ROS rearrangements isnow mandatory in NSCLC,ALK,ROS1,1
 Results The dual ALKROS FISH probe test results were fully concordant with the results of previous singleALK and ROS FISH tests  ALK and  ROS rearrangements without any falsepositive results,ROS1,ALK,0
frdiscovery of EGFR activating mutations w of NSCLC ALKrearrangements w of NSCLC and ROS rearrangementsw of NSCLC led to major changes in the therapeuticstrategy,EGFR,ROS1,1
 Forboth ALK and ROS the same cutoff of   of tumor nucleiwith rearranged signals using FISH testing is used to consider atumor as having ALK or ROS rearrangement,ALK,ROS1,1
 In addition to EGFR ALK and ROS othergenetic alterations eg RET or NTRK rearrangements BRAFPIKCA MET and HER mutations or immune checkpointsprogrammed cell death programmed cell death ligand  axis arepromising targets and require specic testing,RET,NTRK1,1
 In the presentstudy we evaluated the performance of  certied for in vitro diagnosis CEIVD procedure using  dual ALK and ROS FISH probeon  set of NSCLC samples enriched in tumors with ALK andROSrearranged status,ALK,ROS1,1
 EGFR and KRAS NGS analyses Ion Torrent LifeTechnologies and ALK and ROS analyses using FISH and IHCsee below for details in the ALK and ROS Reference Status section were conducted as part of the diagnostic workup for thetherapeutic management of patients with advanced stages ofe Clinical Lung CancerSeptember NSCLC according to the French National Cancer Institute guidelines,EGFR,KRAS,1
 Our set of tumor samples wasenriched with ALK and ROSrearranged samples according toinitial FISH and IHC results to evaluate the performance of the dualALK and ROS FISH probe with differing ALK and ROS status,ROS1,ALK,1
or ROSALK and ROS Reference StatusIn daily practice before the new guidelines from France in we systematically used both ALK FISH Vysis LSI ALK Dual ColorBreak Apart Rearrangement Probe Abbott Molecular and ALKIHC clone A dilution  Clinisciences Nanterre Francewhich is with the DF clone  of the  clones proposed for ALKIHC testing in our French guidelines analyzed independently by pathologists to screen for ALKNSCLC in patients with advanceddisease,ROS1,ALK,1
 The diagnoses about ALK and ROSstatus were collected and compared with the results of the dual ALKand ROS FISH probe see previous reports for more detail of theFISH and IHC procedures,ALK,ROS1,1
Dual ALK and ROS FISH Probe TestingWe used the FlexISH ALKROS DistinguISH Probe ZytoVision GmbH Bremerhaven Germany on mm tissue sections,ALK,ROS1,0
  Case  With No ALK or ROS Rearrangement But IncreasedROS Copy Number eg  ROS Copies in This Tumor Nuclei  Merged Channels  Green Channel  OrangeRedChannel  AquaBlue Channel FlexISH ALKROS DistinguISH Probe Original Magnication ,ALK,ROS1,1
andSpectrumAquaFrom  practical viewpoint the FISH procedure was the same asthat previously reported for single ALK and ROS probes,ALK,ROS1,1
  rearrangement was considered present if the pathologists observed   of tumor nuclei containing rearrangedsignals about ALK or ROS counts performed for  nucleiper observer and added to produce the nal percentages ofrearranged nuclei,ALK,ROS1,1
ResultsFISH  samples were ALK IHC,ALK,ROS1,0
 According to the initialFISH Abbott Molecular probes and IHC results  samples were,ALK,ROS1,1
 Among the samples lacking FISH positivity criteria  samplesfrom patients  and  presented with   of tumor nucleiALK signals  sample patient  had  polysomicwith isolated amplied ROS status ie   ROS copies per tumor nuclei and samples had other known oncogenic molecular alterations  withEGFR LR and  with KRAS GC mutations,ROS1,KRAS,1
  samples were ROS IHCFISHFISH,ROS1,ALK,0
The dual ALK and ROS FISH test also conrmed the atypicalFISH patterns previously obtained,ALK,ROS1,0
 New molecular genetics technologies such as NGS RNA sequencing or NanoString geneexpression proling technologies offer opportunities to analyzeconcurrently many oncogenicsubjecttorearrangement targets such as the ALK and ROS rearrangementsconsidered in our study,ALK,ROS1,1
 The results were in absolute concordance with those fromthe single classically used ALK FISH and ROS FISH tests withoutany falsepositive or falsenegative results,ALK,ROS1,0
 As  consequence withthe nowrecommended NSCLCdedicated guidelines for rstlineIHC screening of ALK and ROS expression this dual ALK andROS FISH test could become  valuable CEIVD test to conrmdruggable oncogenic alterations in NSCLC in the case of  score of or  for ALK IHC or in the case of  score of   or for ROS IHC,ALK,ROS1,1
 In addition to the current proposed guidelines performing the dual FISH test in the rst line eg in patients without asmoking history with frequent oncogenic rearrangements even inthe case of negative IHC test results could also permit the detectionof some patients with ALK IHCwho could also be treatedFISH,ALK,ROS1,1

 Some of themsuch as MET amplications not tested in our study could also bepredictive markers of response to crizotinib therapy and couldperhaps explain the response to crizotinib of some cases withdiscrepant ALK IHC and FISH ndings,MET,ALK,1
 Thus in addition to the  uorochromescombined in the dual ALK and ROS FISH test we studied in thecase of future approval of targeted therapies for NSCLC harboring anew oncogenic rearrangement eg involving RET or NTRK itwould seem feasible to design  new multiplex FISH test to searchconcurrently for several rearrangements,ALK,ROS1,1
 In  different oncogenesusing  combination of  uorochromes ie red and greenlabeledbreak apart probes for the  oncogenes with colabeling with anaqua uorochrome for  oncogene as designed for the ROS part ofthe dual ALK and ROS FISH test and  gold uorochrome foranother the third targeted oncogene would not have had additionalcolabeling eg as the ALK part of the dual ALK and ROS FISHtest,ROS1,ALK,1
ConclusionMultiplexed FISH testing is  valuable approach to search forboth ALK and ROS rearrangements in  single slide of  NSCLCtissue sample,ALK,ROS1,1
Clinical Practice Points The search for targetable ALK and ROS rearrangements andother molecular analyses eg EGFR analysis is now mandatoryin NSCLC,ALK,ROS1,1
 We evaluated  dual ALK and ROS FISH probe in  set of tumor samples enriched in ALK and ROSrearranged NSCLC and  cases respectively,ALK,ROS1,1
 We observed fully concordant results with the results of thesingle ALK and ROS FISH tests,ALK,ROS1,1
 Multiplex FISH tests analyzing ALK and ROS and possiblysoon other relevant targets such as RET and NTRK from thesame FISH slide could help spare tumor tissue for multiplebiomarker testing in patients with NSCLC,ALK,ROS1,0

 Mechanically miRep wasconrmed as  direct target of ZEBAS and negatively regulated by ZEBAS via competing endogenous RNA ceRNA mechanism miRep inhibited ZEB expression by directly binding to theUTR,ZEB1-AS1,ZEB1,1
 Importantly as predicted by JASPAR and further conrmed by luciferase reporter gene and ChIPassays we found ZEB could bind to the promoter region of ZEBAS to activate its expression,ZEB1,ZEB1-AS1,1
Restoration of ZEB could partially abolished the action of ZEBAS silencing on cell proliferation andapoptosis,ZEB1,ZEB1-AS1,1
 And the hypothesized that ZEBAS might participate in the regulation of ZEB by sponging miRNAs has been validated by several studies ,ZEB1-AS1,ZEB1,1
 The ZEBAS and ZEB UTR luciferase reporter vectorwas constructed by Genechem Shanghai China and sitedirectedmutagenesis was performed using the Quick Change Lightning kitStratagene La Jolla CA USA to construct mutant type of ZEBASand ZEB UTR,ZEB1-AS1,ZEB1,1
 To investigate whether ZEBAS can inuence cellapoptosis ow cytometry assay with Annexin FITC and PI doublestaining was carried out,ZEB1-AS1,PI,1
 ZEBAS positively regulates ZEB through sponging miRepIn order to reveal the underlying mechanisms of how ZEBASinvolves in the tumorigenesis of NSCLC we used the ceRNA forZEBAS,ZEB1-AS1,ZEB1,1
 ZEBAS silencing exerts its function on NSCLC cells via  miRepZEB feedback loopA previous study had found that ZEBAS could epigeneticallyactivate ZEB mRNA  we thus perform additional assay to,ZEB1-AS1,ZEB1,1

 Rescue assay demonstrated that overexpression of ZEB atleast partly abolished ZEBAS silencing induced inhibition of cellproliferation Fig,ZEB1,ZEB1-AS1,1

  Western blotting showed the relative expression of ZEB protein in A cell with orwithout ZEBAS knockdown,ZEB1,ZEB1-AS1,1
  lncRNA ZEBAS expressionin response to ZEB overexpression was examined using RTqPCR,ZEB1-AS1,ZEB1,1
  Putative ZEBAS binding sites predicted by JASPAR within the promoter region of ZEB were shown,ZEB1-AS1,ZEB1,1
 ZEBAS cold directly bind and recruit myeloid andlymphoid or mixedlineage leukemia  MLL to ZEB promoter intumor cell lines ,ZEB1-AS1,ZEB1,1
 Interestingly theresults of our integrated experiments showed that ZEB binds tothe promoter region of ZEBAS and promotes its transcription,ZEB1,ZEB1-AS1,1
Consistent with this observation ZEB overexpression resulted inhigher ZEBAS expression and restoration of ZEB attenuatedsuppressed proliferation and enhanced apoptosis induced by ZEBAS silence,ZEB1,ZEB1-AS1,1

MET amplication has been reported in  of treatmentnaive patients with NSCLC and was associated with adismal prognosis and resistance to EGFR TKIs,MET,EGFR,1
 Thisassociation provides  rationale for combining MET inhibitorswith EGFR TKIs or antiagiogenic drugs,MET,EGFR,1
 Preliminary data from an ongoing phase IbIIstudy evaluating the safety and efcacy of XL in combination with erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC produced encouraging results in patients with an EGFR TMresistance mutation  patients demonstrated SD and inpatients with MET amplication  patients had some tumorshrinkage,EGFR,MET,1
Patients with the EMLALK fusion demonstrated anextraordinary response to the MET and ALK inhibitor crizotinib in  phase II trial,MET,ALK,1
 KRAS mutations are usually mutually exclusive to EGFR mutations and occur early in the development of smokingrelated carcinomas Table ,KRAS,EGFR,1
 MutantKRAS is associated with low RRs to EGFR therapies but asKRASmutant lung cancers have similar outcomes on EGFRTKIs as EGFR wildtype lung cancers it is possible that theonly real impact of KRAS mutation is that its presence impliesan absence of  sensitizing EGFR mutation,EGFR,KRAS,1
 Although presence of  KRAS mutation did not seem to have animpact on survival of patients treated with EGFR TKIs orEGFR monoclonal antibodies in some studies addingerlotinib to frontline chemotherapy was associated with asignicant worsening of PFS and OS in patients with KRASmutations,KRAS,EGFR,1
RECEPTOR TYROSINE PROTEIN KINASE ERBBThe HER oncogene  member of the EGFR familyencodes transmembrane receptors that drive and regulate cellproliferation,HER2,EGFR,1
 The HER receptor does not have  knownligand and is putatively activated by homodimerization withother HER receptors or by heterodimerization preferentiallywith either EGFR or HER,HER2,EGFR,1
 The most frequent mutationis YVMA  ins which was associated with constitutive activation of HER kinase leading to phosphorylation ofdownstream effectors such as AKT and MEK,HER2,AKT,1
 Nevertheless  small proportion of patients may have coexisting HER and EGFR mutations,HER2,EGFR,1
 Patients with HER mutations are resistant toEGFR TKIs irrespective of their EGFR mutation status asprogrowth signals are executed through HER kinase,HER2,EGFR,1
 PIKCA amplication has beenreported in approximately  to  of patients with NSCLCand can have  role in EGFR TKI resistance,PIK3CA,EGFR,1
 Preclinical data and early clinical experiments suggest that coexisting KRAS and PIKCA mutationsmay be associated with resistance to PIKAKTmTOR axisinhibitors but KRASmutated NSCLC may respond to aMEK inhibitor,KRAS,PIK3CA,1
 Importantly these agents might beactive even in the absence of  PIKCA mutation owing toalterations at other levels of the PIKAKTmTOR pathwaysuch as PTEN loss AKT mutations and other aberrations,PIK3CA,PTEN,1
 To address this issue clinical trials that combine EGFR and MET kinase inhibitor therapy have beendeveloped,EGFR,MET,1
 It has been observed that patients withNSCLC with activating EGFR mutations and secondary resistance to EGFR TKIs may lose the mutation underlyingacquired TM resistance or PIKCA mutation on discontinuation of EGFR TKIs,EGFR,PIK3CA,1
 MET amplication occurs with orwithout TM mutations in EGFR mutant lung tumors with acquiredresistance to getinib or erlotinib,MET,EGFR,1
 The EMLALK fusion gene isinvolved in various histologic types of lung cancers from nonsmokerswith wildtype EGFR and KRAS,EGFR,KRAS,1

In addition to TGFb low plasma levels of interleukin IL  and high levels of IL  and IL  have beenfound to correlate with lung toxicity although these ndings havenot been consistent in all studies ,IL6,IL10,1
 the only pretreatment cytokinefound to be associated with RP was IL,RP,IL15,1
 Targeted TherapyFor patients with NSCLC harboring  driver mutation such as EGFRmutation ALK translocation ROS translocation or BRAF mutationtargeted therapy is the rst treatment of choice,ALK,ROS,1
ALK translocations are less frequent  of NSCLC than EGFR mutations and again more frequently observed in adenocarcinoma andnever smokers,ALK,EGFR,1
 Patients with ALK translocated NSCLC tend to be younger than patients with EGFR mutation,ALK,EGFR,1
Similar to ALK translocations ROS translocations are very rare  of NSCLC and appear more frequently in younger age never orlight smokers and adenocarcinoma,ALK,ROS1,1
Older patients with NSCLC harboring an EGFR or BRAF mutation or anALK or ROS translocation are candidate for targeted therapy regardlessof ECOG PS because of the high efcacy excellent tolerance and potential positive impact on QoL and ECOG PS,EGFR,BRAF,1

study we revealed that high expression of SPIN was more frequentin human NSCLC tissues and that NSCLC patients with high levels ofSPIN presented with worse OS and DFS,SPIN1,OS,1
Taken together our data reveal that high expression of SPIN is morefrequent in human NSCLC tissues and that NSCLC patients with highlevels of SPIN presented with worse OS and DFS suggesting thatSPIN functions as an important independent biomarker that couldpredict the clinical outcome of human NSCLC,SPIN1,OS,1
 Furthermore we demonstrated that miR downregulates PTEN RASSF and TIMP expression by directly targeting the untranslated region of these target genes,RASSF8,TIMP2,1
 Moreover PTEN RASSF and TIMP wereidentied as direct targets of miR,RASSF8,TIMP2,1
 The UTR of PTEN RASSF and TIMP was PCRamplied from A genomic DNA and cloned downstream of luciferasegene in pGL vector Promega,RASSF8,TIMP2,1

 This phenomenon wastotally dependent on JAK signaling molecules while IRF deciency in murine lung cancer cells partiallyattenuated the IFNinduced increase in PDL,JAK,IRF9,1
 IFN interacts with thetype  IFN receptor complex composed of the IFNAR and IFNARsubunits to trigger phosphorylation of JAK family kinases JAK andTyk,IFN,IFNAR1,1
 Subsequently STAT family of transcription factors STAT andSTAT are activated and become associated with IRF to form theIFNstimulated gene factor ISGF  complex which in turn translocates into the nucleus to bind to the specic target sequences attranscriptional promoter regions of the interferon stimulated genesISGs ,STAT,STAT1,1
 An IFN stimulus resulted in phosphorylation of STAT in LL cells which wasblocked by an addition of CYT  JAKJAK inhibitor orAZD that inhibits JAK Tyk JAK and JAK SupplementaryFig,STAT1,JAK3,1
IRF is one of the key transcription factors that locate downstream of the type  IFN receptor signaling pathway,IRF9,IFN,1
 However tumors harboring different KRAS mutationsvary in their responses to drugs targeting such downstream molecules which include inhibitors of MEK PIK RAF ERK and AKT,KRAS,AKT,1
However combination therapy with the MEK and AKT inhibitorswas found to be poorly tolerated in recent clinical phase II studiesinvolving patients with multiple myeloma and solid tumors and KRASmutant colorectal cancer  who suffered adverseevents such as rashes and diarrhea,MEK,AKT,1
During the last three decades many investigators have tried todevelop effective RAS inhibitors however whereas inhibitors ofEGFR and ALK have been greatly successful and are currently usedin clinical practice these attempts have failed,RAS,ALK,1
 Researchers havetherefore sought various other strategies to mitigate the effects ofRAS mutations including targeting RAS effectors such as RAF andMEK among others instead of KRAS itself,RAS,RAF,1
 Combination treatment with MEK and AKT inhibitors is more effective than eachdrug alone in human nonsmall cell lung cancer in vitro and in vivo PLoS One  e,MEK,AKT,1
 Phase  study of the MEK inhibitor trametinib in combinationwith the AKT inhibitor afuresertib in patients with solid tumors and multiplemyeloma Cancer Chemother,MEK,AKT,1
Through painstaking analyses of genomic proles in cancer patients  number of targetable gene alterations have been discovered withsome leading to novel therapies such as activating mutations of EGFR BRAF and ALK gene fusions,BRAF,ALK,1
The RAS signaling pathway is frequently activated in lungcancer through mutations of several genes including activatedgene mutations in several growth factor receptors see morebelow KRAS and PIKCA as well as lossoffunction genemutations in PTEN and LKB,RAS,KRAS,1
 The exact molecular mechanisms underlyingthe gene mutation for EGFR and ALK are still elusive,EGFR,ALK,1
 There are four drugs targeting EGFR and three drugsfor ALK,EGFR,ALK,1
 ALK inhibitors are also active in suppressing ROS activity,ALK,ROS1,1
 In patientderived specimens screening of effective inhibitors indicatesthat combined inhibition of EGFR and FGFR can suppresscell proliferation in EGFR mutant cell lines Crystal et al,EGFR,FGFR,1
 About one third of relapsed patientshave additional ALK mutations whereas other patients havemutations in additional genes like EGFR and IGFR orbypass gene mutations downstream of ALK such as MAPKKN and PIKCA HR,ALK,EGFR,1
MEK inhibitorsAs critical RAS downstream signaling effectors MEK havebeen important drug targets for cancer therapy,MEK,RAS,1
Although PIKCA and AKT gene mutations occur frequentlyin EGFR inhibitorthere are no FDAapproved specic inhibitors to target PIKCA and AKT forcancer treatment at the moment,PIK3CA,AKT,1
 In theguidelines detection of EGFR mutations and ALK gene fusions is recommended for lung adenocarcinomas Fig,EGFR,ALK,1
 Testing of EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements is now recommended for all lung adenocarcinomas aswell as those lung cancer patients who are neversmokers,EGFR,ALK,1
Similarly it remains elusive why downstream signaling inhibitors BRAF and MEK inhibitors are not effective in patients with EGFR mutations or KRAS mutations,MEK,EGFR,1

 Multivariate Cox regressionshowed that IL rs gene polymorphism was the only independent factor associated to OS in resected NSCLC patients  ,IL16,OS,1
In this study  not previously treated NSCLC patients from asingle institution were enrolled to investigate the potential role ofILB IL IL IL and IL gene polymorphisms in clinical outcomes,IL13,IL16,1
 To date no other studies have explored the association between IL or ILA and NSCLC outcomes,IL16,IL12A,1
 Howeverother polymorphisms in IL rs rs rsand ILA rs rs rs have reported association with risk of renal cell cancer glioma gastric cancer lungcancer nasopharyngeal cancer hepatocellular carcinoma cervicalFig,IL16,IL12A,1
 Thus it is possible that IL and IL mayregulate cytochrome P enzyme expression via microRNA andsubsequently promote procarcinogen activation and DNA damage,IL16,DNA,1
 Based on above IL and ILA levelsmay play  crucial role on NSCLC prognosis and drug resistance,IL16,IL12A,1
 In our studyno serum ILB IL ILA IL IL levels assessment was determined therefore we cannot establish if they were altered in patients with IL rsGG and ILA rsTT genotypes,IL16,IL12A,1
 IL rs was not associated either with survival inour patients despite  previous study with  Caucasian stage IVpatients reported that the IL rs allele was associatedwith poor OS ,IL6,OS,1

 Activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene EGFR are oncogenic driversin nonsmall cell lung cancer NSCLC but it has remained unknown whether ligandindependent EGFR signaling conferred by EGFR mutation triggers ROS generation in NSCLC cells,EGFR,ROS,1
Results EGFR signaling due to EGFR mutation increased ROS levels in transfected HEKT cells,EGFR,ROS,1
 The expression of CDv isoforms was found to be inversely correlated with basal ROS levels in EGFR mutationpositiveNSCLC cell lines,ROS,EGFR,1
Although the exact mechanisms responsible for intrinsic oxidativestress in cancer cells remain unclear ROS production has been found tobe induced by expression of oncogenes such as those for RAS BCRABLand MYC proteins ,ROS,MYC,1
 The epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR isfrequently overexpressed in various tumor types  and activation ofthis receptor by its ligand EGF elicits an increase in ROS levels ,EGF,ROS,1

 EGFR signaling due to an activating EGFR mutation induces ROSgenerationTo examine the eect of an activated mutant form of EGFR on intracellular ROS levels we transfected HEKT cells with an expressionvector for an Exdel mutant of human EGFR,EGFR,ROS,1
 Expression of the activated receptor induced  marked increase in the intracellular concentration of ROS as measured with theROSsensitive probe HDCFDA and this eect was greatly attenuatedby the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib Fig,ROS,EGFR,1
 These datathus suggested that EGFR signaling conferred by activating receptormutation promotes ROS generation,EGFR,ROS,1
 This variability in ROS levels among EGFR mutationpositive NSCLC cell linessuggested that mechanisms other than oncogenic EGFR signaling mightalso contribute to the regulation of redox balance,ROS,EGFR,1
 Expression of CDv is inversely correlated with basal ROS levels in EGFR mutationpositive NSCLC cells,ROS,EGFR,1
  Basal ROS levels in NSCLC cell lines including four linespositive for activating EGFR mutations and six lines wild type for EGFR were measured onthe basis of DCF uorescence,ROS,EGFR,1

 PC  H  or   cells were transfectedwith CD or control siRNAs and then assayed for surface CDv expression by ow cytometry   and  intracellular GSH content   and  and intracellular ROS levels  and ,CD44,ROS,1
 These ndings suggested that CDv mightregulate ROS levels in NSCLC cells that harbor EGFR mutations,ROS,EGFR,1
 These results thussupported the notion that CDv contributes to ROS defense throughupregulation of GSH synthesis in CDvhigh EGFR mutationpositiveNSCLC cells whereas it does not play such  role in CDvlow EGFRmutated cells,ROS,EGFR,1
 Whereas expression of oncogenes such as those for BCRABLFLTLTD MYC and RAS proteins increases ROS levels  antioxidant adaptive mechanisms have been shown to counteract such increased ROS generation in cancer cells with oncogene activation,RAS,ROS,1

 C and  was associated with an increase in theintracellular concentration of ROS that was sensitive to inhibition bythe EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib consistent with previousndings  suggesting that ROS are generated through liganddependent EGFR signaling in NSCLC cells wild type for EGFR,ROS,EGFR,1
 We have now shown that EGFR signaling conferredby an activating EGFR mutation was associated with ROS generation intransfected HEKT cells,EGFR,ROS,1
 However we found that some EGFRmutated NSCLC cell lines show low basal ROS levels suggesting that aredoxadaptive mechanism might be operative in these cells to osetthe increased ROS generation induced by EGFR mutation,ROS,EGFR,1
 We found that the EGFR mutationpositiveNSCLC cell lines that manifested the lowest basal ROS levels expressedCDv at the highest levels and that CDv contributes to ROS defensethrough GSH in these CDvhigh cells but not in CDvlow cells,EGFR,ROS,1
 TheCDvGSH system may therefore constitute  key mechanism to prevent excessive ROS accumulation due to oncogenic EGFR signaling inCDvhigh EGFRmutated NSCLC cells,ROS,EGFR,1
In summary we have shown that EGFR signaling conferred by activating EGFR mutation promotes ROS generation and that CDvplays an important role in redox adaptation by increasing GSH synthesisin EGFR mutationpositive NSCLC cells,EGFR,ROS,1

 Notably EGFR WT patients were more likely to behormone receptorpositive either estrogen receptor  andor progesterone receptorpositive compared toEGFR mutant patients  versus ,EGFR,WT,1
 Recent resultsfrom randomized prospective trials have presented ndings showingthat most patients with EGFR WT tumors do not benet from treatmentwith EGFR inhibitors alone  and the prescribing indication forEGFR inhibitors in NSCLC was therefore limited to rstline maintenance or secondline therapy in patients with metastatic disease,EGFR,WT,1
 Although EGFR inhibitors are no longer recommendedin patients who lack EGFR driver mutations our analysis conductedfrom  to  demonstrates activity of an EGFR inhibitor whencombined with antiestrogen therapy among EGFR WT patients thusproviding evidence of potential crosstalk between these pathways,EGFR,WT,1
Within the EGFR WT subset there was  signicant PFS improvement with erlotinib plus fulvestrant,EGFR,WT,1
As anticipated when comparing participants regardless of treatment arm ORR PFS and OS were greatly superior in EGFR mutantpatients when compared to EGFR WT,OS,EGFR,1
 Among  patients for whom EGFR status couldbe assessed  patients had mutations and  were EGFR WT,EGFR,WT,1

 However we found that EGFR WT patients were more likely to behormone receptorpositive either ER andor PgRpositive comparedto EGFR mutant patients  versus ,EGFR,WT,1
 Although there was no improvement in PFS or OS with erlotinib plus fulvestrant among all patients in subgroup analysis among EGFR WT patients erlotinib plusfulvestrant demonstrated an improvement in PFS,OS,EGFR,1
 We acknowledge theEGFR WT subgroup analysis was not  preplanned analysis but do recognize that these results corroborate preclinical studies that estrogenand EGFR play  signicant role in lung cancer pathogenesis,WT,EGFR,1

In this trial the OS and PFS for patients with an EGFR mutationwere similar between the two treatment arms,OS,EGFR,1
 Importantly among the unplanned EGFR WTsubgroup analysis we note that prior investigations have reported ondierences in steroid hormone receptor expression in EGFR mutant ascompared to EGFR WT tumors in the clinic ,EGFR,WT,1
 Consequently the improved PFS and trend toward improved ORRand OS with the combination therapy among EGFR WT patients may bedue in part to enhanced antiestrogen interactions with steroid hormonereceptors enriched in the EGFR WT population,OS,EGFR,1
 However since this study began patientrecruitment the benet of EGFR TKIs in terms of PFS and OS in thetreatment of EGFR WT NSCLCs has come under question culminatingin the recent withdrawal of approval from the US Food and Drug Administration FDA in this setting ,EGFR,OS,1
 The authors acknowledgethat the improved PFS among EGFR WT patients is important as proofof principle and would not advise taking this concept forward amongEGFR WT patients without further substantial evidence to support it,EGFR,WT,1
 Most clinical trials report that no signicant improvements in PFS or OS occur in patients with EGFR WTtumors treated with erlotinib as compared to placebo controls ,OS,EGFR,1
This would indicate that the increase in PFS in EGFR WT patientstreated with fulvestrant plus erlotinib in the current trial may have hadclinical benet due primarily to the addition of the antiestrogen fulvestrant,EGFR,WT,1
 This outcome may be due primarily to an antiestrogen eector to synergy between fulvestrant and erlotinib in EGFR WT patients,EGFR,WT,1
Thus although this study endured slow patient accrual during  time oftremendous change in clinical practice the improvement in PFS inpatients with EGFR WT NSCLC treated with erlotinib and fulvestrant ascompared to erlotinib alone is notable,EGFR,WT,1

Methods  total of  biopsies of NSCLC patients from LatinAmerica Argentina Colombia Peru and Mexico were used extracting genomic DNA to perform direct sequencing of EGFR geneexons  and  and KRAS gene in  samples,DNA,EGFR,1
 The most commonly mutated genes in lungadenocarcinoma are KRAS and EGFR,KRAS,EGFR,1
 KRAS mutation usually occurs atcodon  characterized by to transversions occasionallyat codon  and rarely at codon  which sustains the activationof the RAS signaling pathway,KRAS,RAS,1
Activating EGFR mutations confer  special sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors getinib and erlotinib but patients with KRAS mutations have  lowersurvival and response rate,EGFR,KRAS,1
 In Mexico some mutations of EGFR exons   and  and KRAS genes were detected byTherascreen RGQ PCR Kit QIAGEN Scorpions ARMSmethod which combines two technologies namely ARMSand Scorpions to detect mutations using realtime PCRswhich was performed using  RotorGene  plex HRMQIAGEN according to the manufacturer instructions,EGFR,KRAS,1
 We found higher frequency of EGFR mutations inpatients without KRAS mutation ,EGFR,KRAS,1
 Although most reports indicate that EGFR and KRASmutations are mutually exclusive suggesting the presence ofdifferent pathways of lung carcinogenesis our ndings showthat KRAS mutation may coexist with EGFR mutation ,EGFR,KRAS,1

 MET gene amplication has been described asone of the reasons responsible for acquired EGFR tyrosine kinaseinhibitor resistance,MET,EGFR,1
 Several studies demonstrated that about  to of patients with acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapyharbored MET amplication,EGFR,MET,1
 We hypothesized that the frequency of MET amplicationmay be enriched in EGFR wildtype patients,MET,EGFR,1
 On the basis of previousstudies we evaluated the prevalence of MET gene amplication andoverexpression in EGFR wildtype NSCLC patients from  institutionsin China we also sought to reveal the relevance among clinical pathologiccharacteristics and the prognosis of MET gene abnormality,MET,EGFR,1

  Significantly  human  homologs  of  Drosophila Hippo  and  LATS  tumor  suppressors  MstII  and  LATS can  suppress  tumor  cell  growth  by  phosphorylating  and inhibiting TAZ and its protein highly paralog Yesassociated protein  YAP,LATS,TAZ,1
 After controlling for  the  effects  of  the  above  clinicopathological  factors  the adjusted HR of TAZ positive expression became ,HR,TAZ,1
We also performed an analysis by using propensity score to  adjust  the  effect  of  TAZ  expression  by  transforming  all other confounding variables including age gender smoking history histology TNM stage and adjuvant chemotherapy into  single estimator and revealed that after the adjustment the HR of TAZ expression became ,TAZ,HR,1
  found  that TAZ  was  relatively  low  in  all normal HBE and HBE and immortalized HBE cell lines HBE BEASB and NL but was overexpressed Copyright   by the International Association for the Study of Lung CancerXie et al,TAZ,HBE,1
 The location of TAZ staining in NSCLC is similar to that of YAP  highly paralog of TAZ in lung cancer,TAZ,YAP,1
 Given that YAP and TAZ have independent and overlapping functions it is possible that both YAP and TAZ may be involved in lung tumorigenesis in vivo,YAP,TAZ,1
 DNA microarray analysis identified the oncogenes Cyr and CTGF as downstream transcriptional targets of  TAZ,DNA,CTGF,1
 Interaction of TAZ with the TEAD family of transcription factors was essential for TAZ to activate the  CyrCTGF  promoters  and  to  induce Taxol  resistance,TAZ,TEAD,1
 Taxol resistance in breast cancer cells is mediated by the hippo pathway component TAZ and its downstream transcriptional targets Cyr and CTGF,TAZ,CTGF,1

 In the KL subgroup hypoxia induciblefactor alpha HIFmediated metabolic reprogramming and adaptation to oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress was the hallmarkof tumours with STK inactivation,KL,STK11,1
 These studies consistently seem to indicate that cooccurring STK or KEAP mutationsare associated with worse OS in KRASmutant NSCLCs ,STK11,KEAP1,1
 In vitro analysis of celllines carrying dierent KRAS codon subtypes showed that mutantKRASGC or KRASG  cell lines had decreased levels of phosphorylated AKT and increased RAL activation compared with cell linesharbouring other mutations or wildtype cells,KRAS,AKT,1
 In the BATTLEBiomarkerIntegrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for LungCancer Elimination trial metastatic patients with KRASGC orKRASGVbearing tumours also had lower OS than those with otherKRAS codon variants or KRAS wildtype NSCLCs ,OS,KRAS,1
STK or KEAP which may at least partially contribute to this metabolic diversity  the mutant KRAS allelic content is  major determinant of distinctive metabolic and redox management proles,STK11,KRAS,1
 As progressionfree survival PFS was not signicantly dierentbetween subgroups and in the absence of  control arm it could not beelucidated whether this shorter OS was specically due to  poorprognostic eect of KRAS,OS,KRAS,1

 Theaddition of selumetinib substantially improved responses in mice withKRAS mutations and in those with KRAS and TP comutations but notin mice with KRAS and STK comutations,KRAS,TP53,1
 The drug dosages required tofully block RAS signalling through PIKmTOR and MEK inhibitionmight be too high to be tolerable in humans which might precludeclinical development of this approach,RAS,MEK,1
 Therapeutic inhibition of FGFR and MEK with ponatinibplus trametinib showed synergistic tumour regression in patientderived KRASGVmutant tumour xenografts ,FGFR1,MEK,1
 Other strategies to indirectly block KRAS signallingPreclinical evidence supports that MYC is essential to amplify thetranscriptional programmes activated by MAPK and PIK pathwaysdownstream of RAS signalling ,KRAS,MYC,1
Lung Cancer   of the reasons for pursuing indirect KRAS inhibition was that directinhibition of the catalytic site with nucleotide competitive inhibitors islargely not feasible in vivo partly because of the high anity picomolar of RAS for GTPGDP together with their high intracellularconcentrations ,KRAS,RAS,1
 Accordingly synergistic activity was seen when ARS  was combined withother TKIs including EGFR TKIs or monoclonal antibodies blockingother receptor tyrosine kinases  indicating that combinationsmight be needed to fully block RAS signalling with these compounds,EGFR,RAS,1
 It should benoted that there is preclinical evidence supporting intrinsic rather thanadaptive PDL expression mediated through the activation of downstream RAS signalling pathways including the AKTmTOR pathway or MAPK signalling pathway ,RAS,MAPK,1
 In particular major comutations in TP and STK bothindependently associated with high mutational burden  profoundly inuence the tumourimmune contexture ,TP53,STK11,1
 It has also been demonstrated that thehypermetabolic state generated upon STK loss incites DNA hypermethylation which could lead to IFNdependent gene expressionsilencing resulting in an immuneinert tumour microenvironment,STK11,DNA,1

 On the contraryoverexpression of XIST increased the protein level of PXN in Hcells while ectopic expression of miR abolished the increase ofPXN level in XIST overexpression A cells Fig,XIST,PXN,1

Results Immunohistochemical    and transcriptomic     analyses of NSCLC patients revealed high RALA and RALB expression  was  associated  with  poor  survival,RALA,RALB,1
  In    panel  of    human NSCLC  cell  lines  RALA  and  RALB  had  higher  expression  in KRAS mutant cell lines whereas RALA but not RALB activity was higher in KRAS mutant cell lines,RALA,RALB,1

 Here we combine for the first time  transcriptomic  and  immunohistochemical  IHC  analyses on human samples with molecular manipulation and evaluation of RAS and RAL in human NSCLC cell lines to show that RALA and RALB are both important prognostic factors in  NSCLC  and  drive  tumor  growth  in  vivo,RAS,RALA,1

  To  examine  whether RALA  or  RALB  gene  expression  could  stratify  patient  survival patients were divided into two groups according to gene expression or risk scores and were compared by Cox proportional hazards models and logrank tests see Supplementary Information  Supplementary  Digital  Content    httplinks,RALA,RALB,1
  Analysis  of  RALA  and  RALB membrane and cytoplasmic expression in the tumor samples revealed that NSCLC patients have variable degree of RAL GTPase membrane and cytoplasmic expression Fig,RALA,RALB,1
 There is higher cytoplasmic expression of RALA and RALB compared with membrane expression   ,RALA,RALB,1
 Also  RALA  membrane  expression  is  higher  than  RALB membrane  expression      ,RALA,RALB,1
  Because membrane localization of GTPases is canonically associated with higher activity these data suggest NSCLC specimens harbor more activated RALA than RALB,RALA,RALB,1
 With  IHC  techniques  established  the  correlation  of  RALA  and  RALB  membrane  and  cytoplasmic expression with patient survival was evaluated,RALA,RALB,1
  RALA  and  RALB  expression and activity were detected in all lines Fig,RALA,RALB,1
  Quantification  of  expression  by  densitometry revealed  average  RALA  and  RALB  expression  was  higher in KRAS mutant lines compared to WT lines   ,RALA,RALB,1

 Cell lines with KRAS mutations trended toward high RALA ,KRAS,RALA,1
 We carried out RALA and RALB IHC on the abovementioned cell lines to study the relationship of RAL activation to  RAL  membrane  and  cytoplasmic  expression  and  found  no  relationship,RALA,RALB,1
  For  these  experiments  we  used  KRAS WT  NSCLC  cell  lines  and  cell  lines  with  KRAS  mutation  in  codon    the  most  common  KRAS  mutation  site in NSCLC,KRAS,WT,1
 RAL GTPase depletion was performed using specific RAL siRNAs targeting RALA RALB or  motif common  to  both  RALA  and  RALB    leading  to simultaneous knockdown,RALA,RALB,1
 RAL GTPase knockdown was evaluated    hours  after  siRNA  transduction  by  Western blotting for RALA and RALB and identified   to  depletion  of  RALA  RALB  or  both  proteins  in  all  lines Supplementary  Figure    Supplemental  Digital  Content   httplinks,RALA,RALB,1
  Depletion  of  RALA RALB or both resulted in inhibition of anchorage dependent  and  independent  growth  of  four  of  six  KRAS  WT and five of six KRAS mutant NSCLC cell line   ,KRAS,WT,1
 Loss of RALA versus RALB versus both proteins had  different  degrees  of  growth  inhibition,RALA,RALB,1
  Depletion  of RALA had the greatest effect with inhibition of monolayer growth  in  two  of  six  KRAS  WT  NSCLC  cell  lines  compared with five of six KRAS mutant cell lines   ,RALA,KRAS,1
 and inhibition of anchorage independent growth in one of six KRAS WT cell lines compared with four of six KRAS mutant cell lines   ,KRAS,WT,1
 H had nearcomplete inhibition of colony formation with RALA knockdown whereas knockdown of RALB or both proteins resulted in  and  inhibition,RALA,RALB,1
  Interestingly investigation of the PIKAKT and MAPK pathways which also signal downstream of KRAS revealed that these alternate pathways had minimal to no activation in NSCLC cell lines that carry the KRAS GC mutation Supplementary Figure  Supplemental Digital Content  httplinks,MAPK,KRAS,1
 The H cell line was chosen because it is KRAS WT has high RALA and  expression but its anchorage independent growth is independent of RAL expression Table ,KRAS,RALA,1

 C stratification of patients by KRAS and RALA mRNA expression status found high KRAS and RALA mRNA expression was associated with poor recurrencefree survival compared with patients with high KRAS and low RALA mRNA expression      ,KRAS,RALA,1
 C suggested that KRAS risk score impacts the prognostic stratification driven by the RALA risk score with high RALA and KRAS mRNA expression  now  associated  with  poor  overall  survival  compared with patients with high RALA and low KRAS mRNA expression   ,KRAS,RALA,1
 These analyses indicate that KRAS  and  RALA  can  contribute  independently  to  patient prognosis  despite  their  canonical  hierarchical  relationship,KRAS,RALA,1
  similar analysis was carried out for KRAS and RALA in GSEGPL in which high RALB mRNA expression predicted poor overall patient survival Fig,KRAS,RALA,1
We also evaluated the interaction of RALB and KRAS expression  in  the  two  data  sets  where  high  RALA  mRNA GSE  or  risk  score  GSE  is  predictive  of  poor patient  outcome  but  no  interaction  was  observed,RALB,KRAS,1
  However in data set GSEGPL patients with high KRAS and RALB mRNA expression had poor overall survival compared with patients with high KRAS and low RALB mRNA expression   ,KRAS,RALB,1
 Patients with high KRAS and RALB mRNA  expression  trended      ,KRAS,RALB,1
  toward  poor  overall survival  compared  with  patients  with  low  KRAS  and  high RALB mRNA expression Fig,KRAS,RALB,1
 This protein analysis was followed up with an evaluation of RALA and RALB mRNA expression where  higher  levels  were  associated  with  shorter  recurrencefree and overall survival Fig,RALA,RALB,1
 Interestingly we noted that in the patient data sets IHC or microarray either RALA or RALB primarily carried the prognostic information Fig,RALA,RALB,1
  RALA  expression seemed  more  important  in  driving  growth  in  KRAS  mutant NSCLC cell lines compared with KRAS WT cell lines suggesting that in this panel of NSCLC cell lines RALA is the functionally  dominant  isoform  driving  KRASdependent tumor growth Table  Fig,RALA,KRAS,1
 Interestingly cell lines with  GC KRAS activating mutation had greater dependence on RAL for anchorage independent growth compared with lines with other codon  mutations or KRAS WT Table  Fig,KRAS,WT,1
 Furthermore NSCLC cell lines H and H with the GC  mutation  had  minimal  activation  of  PIKAKT  and MAPK pathways downstream of RAS Supplementary Figure  Supplemental Digital Content  httplinks,MAPK,RAS,1
 The lack of alternate pathway activation in these cell lines suggested that they are dependent on RAL signaling for their tumorigenic phenotype whereas those cell lines with activation  of  PIKAKT  and  MAPK  pathways  downstream of KRAS are partially dependent or not dependent on RAL GTPase because of the availability of these alternate pathways for tumor progression Table ,MAPK,KRAS,1
  Because  inhibitors  of  downstream RAS signaling pathways such as PIKAKT and MAPK pathways are in clinical investigation in KRAS mutant NSCLC these studies serve as  strong impetus for the development of antiRAL therapeutics to suppress KRASdriven signal propagation  and  improve  poor  clinical  outcomes  seen  in  NSCLC patients,RAS,MAPK,1

 After conventionally fractionated RT we noted the expected robustphosphorylation of DNAPKcs at Thr and Ser aswell as ATM at Ser to repair DNA DSBs in vitro,ATM,DNA,1
However because induction in DNA DSBs and corresponding NHEJ repair is similar in  NSCLC cell lines wespeculated that the difference in LQ model estimates andNSCLC patient survival after ablative HFRT might be inpart due to different mechanisms including vascularstromal endothelial damage antitumor immunity activationthe eradication of subpopulations of tumor stem cells andnecroptosis  ,DNA,NHEJ,1

 According to the European Societyof Medical Oncology ESMO recommendations EGFR and ALK analysisare recommended in all advanced nonsquamous lung carcinoma and inadvanced squamous carcinoma presenting  minimal or remotesmoking history,EGFR,ALK,1
 Becauseof the upcoming availability of new interesting results about othertargeted agents for instance crizotinib in ROS amplications dabrafenib or vemurafenib for BRAF mutations  trastuzumabafatinib or dacomitinib for HER mutations  it could be soonnecessary to routinely perform further molecular tests as ROS HERBRAF and others,ROS1,BRAF,1

 ALK translocation and EGFR or KRAS mutationswere the most screened molecular analysis,ALK,EGFR,1
 The EGFR test was performed in the vast majority of patients while the ALK rearrangementwas requested only in  of cases,EGFR,ALK,1
 Because ALK rearrangements areoften mutually exclusive with EGFR and KRAS mutations  theseanalyses are usually required in  sequential manner but this strategy isnot automatically set up in all oncological centres with the risk ofleaving out same cases,ALK,EGFR,1

Materials and methods The association of EGFR and ILF in expression and regulations was rst investigated inthis study,EGFR,ILF3,1
Results We found that EGFR induced ILF expression and YM reduced EGFR expression,EGFR,ILF3,1
 The knockdown ofILF reduced not only EGFR expression in mRNA and protein levels but also cell proliferation in vitro and in vivodemonstrating that ILF may play an important role in contributing to cancer cell survival,EGFR,ILF3,1
  previous study has also indicated that increase of EGFR expression is observed in the PCderived afatinib resistant cells which isaccompanying with KRAS amplication increased insulinlike growthfactor  receptor IGFR activity and AKT phosphorylation or theT  mutation ,EGFR,KRAS,1
 Therefore wehypothesized that ILF was regulated by EGFR and contributed to EGFRfunction through stabilization and phosphorylation of EGFR,ILF3,EGFR,1
 The specic antibodies against EGFRpEGFR Y ErbB and GAPDH were purchased from CellSignaling Danvers Massachusetts USA and ILF were purchasedfrom Proteintech Chicago Illinois USA,GAPDH,ILF3,1
 EGFR induced ILF expression in lung adenocarcinoma A cancercellsIn this study we assumed that ILF could be  putative target toimprove the ecacy of antiEGFR therapeutics through suppressingcancer stemness,EGFR,ILF3,1
 To characterize our assumption we rst investigatedthe regulations between EGFR and ILF ,EGFR,ILF3,1
 Since EGFR and ILF bothinduce survivin expression  we hypothesized that EGFR iscapable of evoking ILF expression in tumors,EGFR,ILF3,1
 To test the hypothesisthe EGFRpositive lung cancer cell lines including HCC EGFREA deletion and A EGFR wild type were selected to investigate the relationship between EGFR and ILF,EGFR,ILF3,1
 The data of qPCRrevealed that the mRNA levels of EGFR and ILF were higher inHCC than that in A Fig,EGFR,ILF3,1
 We also conrmed and found thatthe protein levels of EGFR and ILF were higher in HCC comparedto A by Western blots whereas HCC was an EGFR autophosphrylation cell line Fig,EGFR,ILF3,1
 To investigate whether EGFR regulatedILF expression A cells were incubated with  ngmL of EGFfollowed by measurement of ILF level in  timedependent manner,EGFR,ILF3,1
We found that EGF induced the expression of ILF mRNA and protein,EGF,ILF3,1
 EGFR induced ILF expression in EGFRpositive lung cancers,EGFR,ILF3,1
  and  EGFRpositive HCC and A lung cells were analyzed for observing EGFR and ILF expression,EGFR,ILF3,1
 HigherEGFR and ILF expression were found in HCC compared to that in A cells whereas HCC was an EGFR autophosphrylation cell line,ILF3,EGFR,1
  and  EGF induced ILF expression in  timedependent manner both on mRNA and protein levels,EGF,ILF3,1
  Afatinib  tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting to EGFR andHER was used to block EGFRmediated pathway and we found that afatinib reduced the mRNA levels of ILF,EGFR,ILF3,1
  Therefore Western blots was performed to detect the protein levels of EGFR and ILF in afatinib and YM treatments,EGFR,ILF3,1
 The resultindicated that afatinib and YM both reduced EGFR and ILF protein levels implying that EGFR and ILF regulated mutually,EGFR,ILF3,1
 Next afatinib aTKI against both EGFR and HER was used to block EGFRmediatedpathways,EGFR,HER2,1
 The results demonstratedthat afatinib decreased both EGFR and ILF levels and YM causedthe same inhibitory phenomena Fig,EGFR,ILF3,1
 B conrming that EGFR and ILF regulated each other mutually,EGFR,ILF3,1
 Discovery of ILFmediated gene expression in lung cancer A cellsBesides EGFR expression that was regulated by ILF we furthermore investigated the dierential gene expressions in AshILF byRNAseq in order to uncover genes potentially regulated by ILF in theEGFRpositive lung cancer,EGFR,ILF3,1
 Since ILF was regulated by EGFR Fig,ILF3,EGFR,1
 The knockdown of ILF reduced EGFR expression and inhibited tumor growth,ILF3,EGFR,1
  NetworkAnalyst revealed that EGFR was associated with ErbB IRS and IGFR,EGFR,IGF1R,1
 We have demonstrated that YM inhibited cancerstemlike tumorsphere formation and YM was considered as  potential agent to enhance the therapeutic ecacy of afatinib whichblocks phosphorylation of EGFR and HER,EGFR,HER2,1
 YM ngmL not only reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR induced by ngmL of EGF in   but also repressed the expression of ErbB andOct  stem cell marker in   Fig,EGFR,EGF,1
 Previously we have found that YM serves asan inhibitor of caner stemness through inhibiting EGFR levels andphosphorylation  suggesting that YMdirect binding of ILF contributes to the formation of cancer stemlike tumorspheres derivedfrom HCC and A,EGFR,ILF3,1
 In this study we found that ILF is  downstream oncoprotein of EGFR,ILF3,EGFR,1
 We found that ILF enhanced the expressions oftumor survivalassociated EGFR and other oncoproteins such as ErbBIRS IGFR and FGFR,ILF3,EGFR,1
 ILF regulates not only EGFR but alsoErbB IRS IGFR and FGFR as investigated by RNAseq techniqueand conrmed by qPCR,ILF3,FGFR4,1
Lung Cancer   to be  drug resistant oncogene regulated by EGFR and MET in TKIresistant HCC cells ,EGFR,MET,1
 Since we found that the knockdown of ILF reducedErbB expression we proposed that YM blocked the EGFR phosphorylation and synergized the ecacy of afatinib was through reducing the ErbB expression,ILF3,EGFR,1
In conclusion this study investigated and demonstrated that ILF isa downstream protein of EGFR and mutually regulates EGFR expression,ILF3,EGFR,1

 However acquiredresistance to getinib and erlotinib via EGFRmutant NSCLC has occurred through variousmolecular mechanisms such as TM secondary mutation MET amplication hepatocytegrowth factor HGF overexpression PTEN downregulation epithelialmesenchymal transition EMT and other mechanisms,MET,PTEN,1
 However the following  main molecular mechanisms might exist and cause cells to survivewhich leads to NSCLC relapse rst the issue of the ATP binding site of EGFR ,ATP,EGFR,1
 MET amplication and HGF overexpression and third others mechanisms ,MET,HGF,1
 Moreover from in vitro and in vivo studies ligand bindingof EGFR also causes MET amplication ,EGFR,MET,1
 Interestinglyin vitro data have demonstrated that the MET inhibitorXL is  more efcient inhibitor of lung adenocarcinomacells with EGFR TM and MET amplication than eitherreversible erlotinib or irreversible CL or CL EGFRinhibitors ,MET,EGFR,1

 In the presence of anEGFRTKI HGF promotes the selection of cells with MET amplication and encourages the emergence of resistance throughMET amplication ,HGF,MET,1
 Moreover HGF accelerates the development of MET amplication both in vitro and in vivo getinibresistance due to MET amplication or autocrine HGF productioncan be cured in vivo by combined EGFR and MET inhibition ,HGF,MET,1
ERBB activationAlthough ERBB is unique among the EGFR family because itlacks tyrosine kinase activity its  tyrosine phosphorylationsites effectively couple the protein to the PIKAkt pathwayby providing excellent binding sites for PIK ,ERBB3,EGFR,1
 Compensatory ERBB signaling and sustained PIKAkt pathway activation have been implicated in the resistance to TKIs intargeted therapies towards other ERBB family membersin vitro ,ERBB3,ERBB,1
 Using getinibresistant PCcells treatment with AG an IGFR inhibitor combinedwith getinib resulted in an in vitro synergistic effect ininducing apoptosis inhibiting cell proliferation and decreasing the expression of phosphorylated EGFR EGFR Aktand ERK which suggests that addition of an antiIGFRmodulator in combination with getinib treatment may bemore effective than  singleagent approach ,IGF1R,EGFR,1
 Inone in vitro study ectopic expression of BRAF VE or BRAFGA conferred resistance to erlotinib in PC cells thatharbored drugsensitive EGFR mutations ,BRAF,EGFR,1
 Meanwhile among lung cancer patientswith EGFR mutations survival was longer in those with highPTEN expression than in those with low PTEN expression ,EGFR,PTEN,1
 Thecharacterization of acquired resistance mechanisms to EGFRinhibitors has led to the design of several clinical trialsassessing the efcacy of EGFR TMinhibiting agents combination therapy with EGFR TKIs inhibitors of MET or PIKAkt HSP inhibitors and RASpathway inhibitors ,EGFR,MET,1

 Specifically transcriptome sequencing has enabled the discovery  of  novel  ROS  and  RET  fusion  genes  resulting from somatic tumor genome rearrangements and subsequent research  has  verified  the  oncogenic  potential  for  some,ROS1,RET,1
 Although  the  prevalence  of  ROS  and  RET  fusion  genes are  approximately    to    in  tumors  from  an  unselected population  of  NSCLC  patients  there  is  great  interest  to establish  robust  methods  for  detection  with  application  to research and clinical outcomes,ROS1,RET,1
 The expression of ROS and RET fusion genes occurs in the absence of other cancer driver mutations and this mutual exclusivity can be used to enrich patient populations for treatment with targeted agents,ROS1,RET,1
 Also NSCLC patients expressing ROS or RET fusion genes show unique  clinicopathologic  features  that  can  facilitate  therapeutic  selection  ,ROS1,RET,1
  Finally  at  the  protein level ROS and RET are kinases and smallmolecule kinase inhibitor  drugs  shown  to  target  ROS  ,ROS1,RET,1
 Based on these advantages we elected to adapt the same test platform for detecting the expression of documented  oncogenic  ROS  and  RET  fusion  genes,ROS1,RET,1

DISCUSSIONHere we have developed the first mass spectrometrybased assay to simultaneously detect the expression of known oncogenic ROS and RET fusion genes in NSCLC,ROS1,RET,1
Due to the low frequency of ROS and RET gene rearrangements  in  patient  specimens  we  used  synthetic  cDNA and biospecimens from NSCLC cell lines to test the specificity  and  accuracy  of  each  assay  in  our  multiplexed  panel,ROS1,RET,1
 To  the  best  of  our  knowledge  there  are  only  two  cell  lines available  derived  from  NSCLC  reported  to  express  ROS or  RET  fusion  genesROSSLCA  SL  R  in  the HCC cell line and CCDCRET in the LCad cell lineand  our  assay  detected  both  the  fusions  accurately,ROS1,RET,1
  With highthroughput  sequencing  of  greater  numbers  of  NSCLC transcriptomes  additional  oncogenic  variants  of  the  ROS and  RET  fusion  genes  may  be  discovered,ROS1,RET,1

 The applicability of the assay was further tested using cDNA from two NSCLC cell lines that are known to express ROS  and  RET  fusion  genes  HCC  and  LCad  respectively,ROS1,RET,1
 The  ROS  fusion  gene  junction  comprising  ROS exon    fused  to  SLCA  exon    R  SL  along  with the upstream and downstream wildtype exon junctions were detected  in  all  the  designated  wells  of  the  HCC  cell  line cDNA Fig,ROS1,SLC34A2,1

 Reduced GPD expression by NOX siRNA was also determined at protein levels by western blotting Fig,G6PD,NOX4,1
 NOX induces PPP to generate NAPDH production in A cells,NOX4,PPP,1
 The PPP is  primary source of cellular NADPH and GPD plays an important role in antioxidant metabolism byproducing NADPH ,PPP,G6PD,1

 Inthe present study we found that NOX directed glucose metabolismnot only to the glycolysis but also to PPP pathway in NSCLC cellswhich was independent of mitochondrial function,NOX4,PPP,1
 Besides NOX could also stimulated PPP pathway to produce NADPH,NOX4,PPP,1
 Therefore our ndingssuggest that NOX upregulation could maintain relatively high levels ofreduced GSH due to promoting both the PPP and glutaminolysis,NOX4,PPP,1

 In the experimental results coexisting EGFR and KRAS mutations were found in   of the samples,EGFR,KRAS,1
 Furthermore nearly no coexistence was found between KRAS mutations and EGFR overexpression,KRAS,EGFR,1
 EGFR is known to initiate intracellular signaling pathways triggering  cascade of wellidentified molecular events that protect cancer cells from apoptosis facilitate invasion  inhibit  DNA  repair  and  promote  angiogenesis,EGFR,DNA,1
 These  include  KRAS  and  BRAF  proteins  found  in many tumors as different variations,KRAS,BRAF,1
 However research reports examining nonsmall cell lung carcinoma NSCLC have found that the mutation rate of EGFR and KRAS varies by more than  depending on race and region,EGFR,KRAS,1
 Spano  et  al  showed  that  the  mutation  of  KRAS and EGFR in aggressive cancer cells may be related to the resistance of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor medication,KRAS,EGFR,1
 By analyzing EGFR and KRAS mutations Kosaka et al suggested that both mutations are strictly mutually exclusive despite contrasting reports  from  other  published  work,EGFR,KRAS,1
 To  the  authors knowledge no published work has outlined  complete analysis of the correlation between KRAS and EGFR mutations or overexpression and the clinical manifestations of cancer patients,KRAS,EGFR,1
To understand EGFR and KRAS alterations among the tissues of lung cancer patients in Taiwan and to further discuss the association between the coexistence of the two we used tumor tissues collected  from  NSCLC  patients  and  performed   complete analysis on the proportion of EGFR overexpression  and  mutation  in  the  tissue,EGFR,KRAS,1
  This research  aimed  to  help  understand  the  role  of EGFR and KRAS in the development of lung cancer in  Taiwan  and  to  aid  the  development  of  new strategies  to  target  lung  adenocarcinoma  using EGFR inhibitors,EGFR,KRAS,1

  These  data  suggestthat  changes  in  the  transcriptional  regulation  of  RAS  AKT  and  ERKmRNAs  and  the  phosphorylation  of  AKT  and  ERK  are  likelyinvolved  in  the  letcmediated  sensitization  of  H  cells  togetinib,AKT,ERK,1
  letc  inhibitor  restored  the  getinib  resistance  of  Hfulvestrant  cells  by  increasing  RAS  expression  and  by  activatingAKT  and  ERK,RAS,ERK,1
    Western  blot  analysis  shows  that  forced  overexpression  of  letc  represses  RAS  expression  andinactivates  AKT  and  ERK  but  does  not  alter  total  ERK  or  total  AKT  levels  in  H  cells,RAS,ERK,1
  Semiquantitative  densitometric  analysis  of  the  western  blots  indicates  thatforced  overexpression  of  letc  signicantly  decreases    RAS  protein  expression  and      AKT  and  ERK  protein  levels  but  does  not  alter    total  AKT  and    total  ERKprotein  in  H  cells,RAS,AKT,1

 The PKD family consists ofthree members PKD PKD and PKD with distinct structuralfeatures and enzymological properties Wang  Rykx et al,PKD,PKD2,1
 PKD expression was analyzedby quantitative realtime PCR and normalized to GAPDH expression,PKD1,GAPDH,1
 We then transiently transfected PKD constitutively active SE mutant plasmid inA cells which were not stimulated with PMA and examinedphosphorylation on SK S Akt and ERK,PKD1,ERK,1
 Eexpression of the constitutively active PKD resulted in the attenuation of SK S Akt and ERK phosphorylation,PKD1,ERK,1
 Inhibitors of PIK and ERK prevent the potentiation of SKinduced by suppression of PKD activityWe next explored the mechanism of the feedback inhibition ofSK activation mediated by PKD,ERK,PKD1,1
 In line withthe preceding results we got in PKD siRNAs transfected cellsPMA also strikingly induced the phosphorylation of Akt at Serand ERK at Thr and Tyr in A cells prior exposed to KbFigs,PKD1,ERK,1

 DiscussionProtein kinase  family contains  members with distinctstructure and function namely PKD PKD and PKD,PKD2,PKD3,1
 Inhibition of PIK ERK and mTOR prevents the activation of SK and S induced by suppression of PKD activity,ERK,PKD1,1
 To testthis hypothesis we inhibited the activity of PKD by inhibitor Kbthen stimulated with  strong PKD activatorphorbol ester PMA,PKD1,PKD,1
 Moreover constitutively active PKD resulted in the inhibition of SKand its substrate S in line with Akt and ERK,PKD1,ERK,1
 Our results showed that the enhancement of SKphosphorylation at Thr and S phosphorylation at Ser incells exposed to Kb then challenged with PMA was completelyblocked by PIK and MEK inhibitors which indicates PKD inhibitsthe activation of mTORCSK at least in part by regulating thekinase activity of Akt and ERK,MEK,PKD1,1
 Activation of Swiss T cells overexpressing PKD by GPCRagonist leads to prolonged activation of the MEKERKRSK pathwaycompared with cells overexpressing kinasedead mutant PKDwhile our results show for the rst time that PKD mediates theinhibition of the ERK activity in NSCLC cells stimulated with PMA,PKD1,ERK,1

  However  despite  these  apparent  similarities  the  specic  role  of  EGFR  and  KRAS  signaling  thevalue  of  associated  predictive  biomarkers  and  therapeutic  implications  remain  quite  distinct  between  the  two  malignancies,EGFR,KRAS,1
  The  KRAS  gene  is  located  on  the  shortarm  of  chromosome    and  point  mutations  especially  at  position    or    in  exon    lead  to  an  impaired  GTPase  activity  whichresults  in  constitutive  activation  of  RAS  signaling  ,KRAS,RAS,1
  In  contrast  to  EGFR  mutations  which  occurmore  frequently  in  tumors  of  never  smokers  some  KRAS  mutations  are  associated  with  tobacco  exposure  especially  transversionmutations     or  ,EGFR,KRAS,1
In  terms  of  predictive  value  in  NSCLC  KRAS  mutations  have  beenassociated  with  primary  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  TKI  resistance  as  conrmed  in    large  metaanalysis  from  Mao  et  al,KRAS,EGFR,1

  Further  datafrom  the  phase    TRIBUTE  trial  in  NSCLC  suggests  that  in  additionto  resistance  to  EGFR  TKIs  that  KRAS  mutation  reduces  efcacyof  carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  chemotherapy  ,EGFR,KRAS,1

 This should be distinguished from our approach in which specific LNs visible on imaging were assessed for the probability of their involvement with malignancy with the goal being more accurate classification of nodes that are otherwise challenging to interpret based on  the  commonly  used  PET  or  CT  criteria  alone,PET,CT,1

 Two recent switch MT studies using bettertolerated agentspemetrexed or erlotinibhave shown significant OS benefit and  have  changed  our  treatment  paradigm  Table  ,MT,OS,1

 Four questions examined  acceptance  of  MT  in  case  of  an  expected  median OS benefit of  year  months  months or  month respectively  one  question  examined  prolonged  symptom  relief  in the absence of expected OS benefit and one prolonged radiological tumor stabilization in the absence of both expected OS benefit or effect on symptoms,MT,OS,1
 The  majority  of  patients  considered  MT  for  an expected OS benefit of  months to  year and this at all three time  points,MT,OS,1
 An  OS  benefit  of    months  was  acceptable  for twothirds at T but decreased slightly to  at T whereas onethird of respondents no longer considered MT at T,OS,MT,1
No  increase  in  OS  but  longer  symptom  relief  by  MT was  important  for    large  majority  of  patients  consistently throughout the study period  of   of  and  of  at T T and T respectively Fig,OS,MT,1

 In patients with low levels of both BRCA and LMO PFS was  months whereas it was not reached in those with low BRCA and high LMO mRNA levels   ,BRCA1,LMO4,1
Conclusions  Low  BRCA  and  high  LMO  levels  were  associated with  longer  PFS  to  erlotinib,BRCA1,LMO4,1
  Baseline  assessment  of  BRCA  and LMO mRNA expression can help predict outcome to erlotinib,BRCA1,LMO4,1
Our  previous  findings  support    predominant  predictive role of BRCA in patients with EGFR mutations through an HAXindependent pathway,BRCA1,EGFR,1
 The DNA breakage caused by  erlotinib  is  different  from  that  caused  by  radiotherapy or  platinumbased  chemotherapy  and  BRCA  by  itself  can be    relevant  predictive  biomarker,DNA,BRCA1,1
  Erlotinib  can  suppress homologydirected repair and increase basal levels of HAX foci  which  are  indicative  of  an  accumulation  of  DNA  doublestrand breaks where BRCA plays an important role,DNA,BRCA1,1
 The precise contact residues are likely to differ because tumorderived mutations in the BRCT domain abolish the interaction of BRCA with CtIP but not with LMO,BRCA1,LMO4,1
 Overexpression of LMO in  subset of  sporadic  breast  tumors  was  found  to  be    mechanism  of BRCA downregulation that may contribute to the pathogenesis of breast cancer,LMO4,BRCA1,1
CtIP is  transcriptional coregulator that binds  number of  proteins  involved  in  cellcycle  control  and  cell  development including BRCA and LMO,BRCA1,LMO4,1
 Although LMO interacts with two regions of CtIP it does not further repress transcription by CtIP on the Gal promoter in contrast to its effect on BRCA activity,LMO4,BRCA1,1
To  shed  further  light  on  the  potential  effect  of  the gene expression of BRCA LMO and CtIP on outcome to EGFR  TKIs  we  have  examined  the  mRNA  expression  of LMO  and  CtIP  in  pretreatment  tumor  samples  of  erlotinbtreated NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations for whom data on BRCA expression and the EGFR TM mutation were available,LMO4,EGFR,1

 LMO interacts  with  the  cofactor  CtIP  and  BRCA  and  inhibits the  transcriptional  activity  of  BRCA  in  both  yeast  and mammalian  cells,LMO4,BRCA1,1
Of  the    erlotinibtreated  EGFRmutant  NSCLC patients included in the present study those with low BRCA expression  had  significantly  longer  PFS  as  did  those  with high LMO expression whereas low LMO levels were associated with shorter PFS which is consistent with findings in breast  cancer  and  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the  anterior tongue,BRCA1,LMO4,1
  Moreover  the  combination  of  low  BRCA  and high LMO mRNA levels identified  favorable subgroup of patients in whom PFS was not reached,BRCA1,LMO4,1
 In addition although overall patients with high BRCA levels had shorter PFS the  patients with high levels of both BRCA and LMO had  significantly longer PFS of  months and  trend toward better overall survival,BRCA1,LMO4,1

Although  the  sample  size  in  this  study  was  relatively small which may possibly explain the lack of significant differences  in  response  rate  and  overall  survival  according  to BRCA  and  LMO  expression  levels  the  finding  that  low BRCA  and  high  LMO  levels  were  associated  with  longer PFS indicates that  potential twogene model based on BRCA and LMO expression merits further investigation to confirm its role in predicting the efficacy of EGFR TKIs in lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR mutations,BRCA1,LMO4,1

  Here  our review  focuses  on  the  oncogenic  role  of  aberrant  ROS  in NSCLC and targeting ROSrearranged NSCLC patients with ALK inhibitors,ROS1,ALK,1
 Wildtype ROS is located on chromosome    and  encodes  fulllength  ROS      amino acid  transmembrane  tyrosine  kinase  TK  receptor  consisting  of  an  extracellular  ligandbinding  domain  composed  of nine repeated fibronectinlike motifs  short transmembrane domain and an intracellular TK domain,ROS1,TK,1
 Using the Multiple Sequence Comparison by LogExpression software  it  has  been  found  that  there  is      amino  acid homology between human ROS and ALK within the kinase domain  and    identity  at  the  adenosine  triphosphate ATPbinding site,ROS,ALK,1
 With the activation of ALK fusion proteins the downstream signaling pathways are similar to ROS RTK activation with the involvement of the RASMAPKERK Janus  kinase  signal  transducers  and  activators  of  transcription and phosphoinositide kinase Akt pathways which control cell proliferation survival and cell cycling,ALK,ROS1,1

 Multivariate analysis showed that stage MET expression and sex were independent prognostic factors in patients with wildtype EGFR   ,MET,EGFR,1
Conclusions These results suggest that MET expression has different prognostic significance in patients with differing EGFR mutation status,MET,EGFR,1
 Whether MET inhibitors should be given early to NSCLC patients with EGFR wildtype needs further investigation,MET,EGFR,1
Although both EGFR and MET have gained considerable attention in the targeted therapy of NSCLC there have been few  largescale studies of the prognostic significance of MET expression and EGFR mutations status in the same cohort of NSCLC patients,EGFR,MET,1
 Thus we investigated the prognostic role of MET expression and EGFR mutation status in  group of NSCLC patients,MET,EGFR,1

 Furthermore the multivariate analysis in our study revealed that positive MET expression was an independent poor prognostic factor in NSCLC patients with  wildtype  EGFR  but  not  in  patients  with  EGFR  mutation,MET,EGFR,1
  Thus  the  prognostic  implications  of  MET  expression may differ depending on the EGFR genetic profile,MET,EGFR,1
 Crosstalk between the MET  and EGFR pathways might be involved,MET,EGFR,1
In  summary  to  our  knowledge  this  is  the  first  report of the prognostic significance of MET expression in patients based on EGFR mutation status,MET,EGFR,1
 Our data suggest that positive MET expression was an independent poor prognostic factor in patients negative for EGFR mutations,MET,EGFR,1

 We established the PCGR line using NNKaccording to  similar procedure but the cells did not harbor acquiredresistance mechanisms including TM and MET amplication orintrinsic resistance mechanisms including KRAS mutations and  lossof PTEN,MET,KRAS,1

 We sought todemonstrate the activity of INC on select NSCLC cell lines both as  single agent and in combination with erlotinibusing exogenous HGF to simulate MET upregulation,HGF,MET,1
 In these models INCtreatment was sufcient to restore erlotinibinduced inhibition of MET GAB AKT and ERK in the presence of HGF,ERK,HGF,1
Conclusion Although the MET inhibitor INC alone had no discernible effect on cell growth it was able to restoresensitivity to erlotinib and promote apoptosis in NSCLC models rendered erlotinib resistant by HGF,MET,HGF,1

ResultsPemetrexed increased MSH expression and thephosphorylation levels of MKK and p MAPK in Hand H cell linesFirst we examined the effects of pemetrexed on signaling moleculesin  human lung cancer cell lines H and H,MSH2,MAPK,1
 Additionally pemetrexed  mM treatment for   increased the MSH protein levels and this wasaccompanied by the activation of MKKp MAPK Fig,MSH2,MAPK,1
E                                       Activation of MKKp MAPK maintained thepemetrexedinduced MSH expressionTo examine whether the induction of MSH expression bypemetrexed was  result of p MAPK signal activation cellswere pretreated with SB  p MAPK inhibitor ortransfected with specic p MAPK siRNA,MAPK,MSH2,1
   Inactivation of p MAPK activity decreased MSH mRNA levels in pemetrexedexposed NSCLC cells,MAPK,MSH2,1
MSH protein levels by pemetrexed resulted from the increase inits protein stability via the activation of p MAPK,MSH2,MAPK,1
 Next the cells were cotreated withpemetrexed and SB to clarify whether p MAPK signalingwas involved in the upregulation of MSH protein stability,MAPK,MSH2,1
 These results suggested that the upregulation ofMKKp MAPK signaling could protect MSH fromubiquitinS proteasomemediated degradationNext we hypothesized p MAPK signaling to be involved in theregulation of MSH stability by preventing the ubiquitinSproteasomemediated proteolysis of MSH,MAPK,MSH2,1
 The inhibitionof p MAPK signaling by SB signicantly increased thelevels of ubiquitinconjugated MSH in pemetrexedtreated NSCLCcell lines Fig,MAPK,MSH2,1
 The results revealed that p MAPK signalingincreased MSH protein stability by protecting MSH from theubiquitinmediated degradation pathway in pemetrexedtreatedNSCLC cells,MAPK,MSH2,1

Archives of Medical Research   eORIGINAL ARTICLEEffect of CYPA MSPI Polymorphism on the Relationship BetweenTP Mutation and CDKNA Hypermethylation in NonsmallCell Lung CancerCong Tan Heyun Xu Chenye Zhang Hu Zhang Chunmei Chen Weimin ZhangbXiaoyu Sun and Yongtang JinaaEnvironmental Epigenetics Laboratory Department of Environmental Medicine School of Medicine Zhejiang University Hangzhou ChinabDepartment of Cardiothoracic Surgery Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital School of Medicine Zhejiang University Hangzhou ChinaReceived for publication June   accepted November   ARCMED,CYP1A1,CDKN2A,0
 Therefore we conductedthis study to determine whether CYPAGSTM polymorphisms can affect the relationship between TP mutation and CDKNA hypermethylation in lung cancer,TP53,CDKN2A,1
CYPA MSPI and GSTM polymorphisms were characterized through PCRRFLP onDNA isolated from peripheral lymphocytes,CYP1A1,GSTM1,1
 After adjusting for age sex smoking degree histology type and TNM stage the correlationbetween TP mutation and CDKNA methylation was signicant in patients withCYPA risk genotype    ,TP53,CDKN2A,0
 This may suggest that TP mutation and CDKNA methylation specically interact to promote lung tumorigenesis in subjects with CYPA risk genotypebut not in those with CYPA wildtype homozygotes implying different pathwaysfor the development of lung carcinoma with respect to CYPA polymorphism,TP53,CDKN2A,1

Both TP and CDKNA are essential regulators of Gcell cycle and their inactivation is associated with cancerdevelopment ,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 In lung cancer TP is frequently inactivated through mutation  and CDKNA through promotermethylation ,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 The positive correlation between defectiveTP reected by TP mutation or p overexpressionand CDKNA inactivation detected by promoter methylation of CDKNA or loss of CDKNA expression was foundin NSCLC  and other cancers e,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 TP mutation and CDKNA methylation can probably interact for lung cancer developmentwe speculated that there may be  link between gene polymorphisms and genegene interaction in the pathogenesis oflung cancer,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 The aim of our study was to investigate theinteraction between TP mutation and CDKNA methylation in lung cancer and whether or not CYPA orGSTM polymorphisms can affect the relationship betweenTP mutation and CDKNA methylation,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 This study was approved by theCYPA MSPI Polymorphism and TP Mutation and CDKNA Hypermethylation in Nonsmall Cell Lung CancerFigure ,TP53,CDKN2A,1

 To examine the effect of more than one factorsimultaneously on TP mutation or CDKNA methylation multivariate logistic regression analysis was usedTable  and TP mutation only correlated signicantlywith squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma vs,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 NeitherCYPA nor GSTM genotype had  signicant relationship with TP mutation according to the univariate analysis data not shown orto the multivariate logisticregression analysis after adjustment for clinicopathologicalfactors Table ,GSTM1,TP53,1
We then asked whether TP mutation and CDKNAmethylation interacted in all participants or in subsetsdened by CYPA or GSTM genotype Table  usingthe same statistical method described by Liu et al,TP53,CYP1A1,1
 Because age smoking degreehistology type and TNM stage could probably affect thefrequency of TP mutation or CDKNA methylationTable  we considered them all as potential confoundingfactors in this analysis,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 It could also beinterpreted that in subjects with the CYPA risk genotypeoccurrence of CDKNA methylation increased the odds ofharboring  TP mutation methylated CDKNA vs,CYP1A1,CDKN2A,1
 or the promoter of CDKNA was more likelyto be methylated when TP was mutated wildtypeTP vs,CDKN2A,TP53,1
 In addition univariate analysisalso revealed that the association between TP mutationand CDKNA methylation was statistically signicant onlyin patients with CYPA risk genotype c  ,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 Our data on TP mutation and CDKNA methylation are in accordance withthose studies,TP53,CDKN2A,1
In our study CYPAGSTM risk genotype was associated with neither TP mutation nor CDKNA methylation,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 This may suggest that the CYPAor GSTM polymorphisms alone cannot signicantly inuence the incidence of TP mutation or CDKNA methylation in lung cancer patients,GSTM1,TP53,1
 showed that mostMany studies have investigated the relationship betweendefective TP and CDKNA inactivation in NSCLChowever inconsistent results were obtained,TP53,CDKN2A,1
CYPA MSPI Polymorphism and TP Mutation and CDKNA Hypermethylation in Nonsmall Cell Lung CancerBoth TP and CDKNA play  vital role in regulatingG cell cycle and studies showed that either one genewould reinforce its function when the other gene was inactivated in normal cell or in vivo without cancer ,TP53,CDKN2A,1
Mice with alterations in both TP and CDKNA displayeda striking increase in lung tumor multiplicity and progression  and loss of p was associated with  furtherincrease in proliferative activity in the ppositivelung tumors but not with proliferative activity in thepnegative lung tumors ,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 These studies suggestedthe collaboration between TP and CDKNA in preventing or promoting tumorigenesis,TP53,CDKN2A,1
Why TP mutation interacted with CDKNA methylation in patients with CYPA risk genotype but not in thosewith CYPA homogeneity wildtype genotype is stillpuzzling,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 In addition DNMTprotein levels in tumors should also be examined in NSCLCpatients with CYPA risk genotype to determine whetherthere is  possible link between TP mutation andCDKNA methylation,CYP1A1,TP53,1

CYPB is mainly an extrahepatic CYP,CYP1B1,CYP,1
However basal CYPB mRNA expression in lung is much highercompared to that of CYPA  as conrmed in our samples,CYP1B1,CYP1A1,1
 However part of the signal detectedcould be due to genomic DNA as suggested by the control RT,DNA,CYP2A7,1
 It hasbeen demonstrated that CYPA is the most efcient CYP in themetabolic activation of NNK methylnitrosaminopyridylbutanone  major tobacco procarcinogen ,CYP2A13,CYP,1
 We detected low CYPC mRNA in PP and low CYPCand CYPC and moderate CYPC and CYPC mRNA in BM,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,1
In tumorallung samples we found reduced expression ofCYPC CYPC and CYPC in SCC relative to BM,CYP2C9,CYP2C19,1
 Alteredexpression of CYPC and CYPC has been previously reported invarious malignant neoplasms  and this may be of importancein the comprehension of chemoresistance as these enzymes playa role in the metabolism of anticancer drugs with CYPC beingthe major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of paclitaxel ,CYP2C8,CYP2C9,1
Moreover our results indicating low levels of CYPD expressionin lung tissues as previously observed  are not infavor of  major impact of this CYP in the local bioactivation ofinhaled toxicants,CYP2D6,CYP,1

 Even if noexpression of CYPF  CYPF  and CYPF  wasfound in the lung by Northern blot analysis more sensitivemethods enabled detection of CYPF mRNA in this tissue  and ofCYPF and CYPF mRNA in trachea  which seems to sharea common subset of CYPs with the lung ,CYP4F3,CYP4F11,1

 although the MTTP ratiowas an independent factor inuencing the MST ratio in the multipleregression model   ,MTTP,MST,1
 This means that the MTTP ratio couldaccount for less than half of the variance in the MST ratio,MTTP,MST,1
Quantitative Data SynthesisTo investigate the association between the difference inMST and in MTTP we dened the MST ratio as the ratio ofMST in the investigation arm to MST in the reference armand the MTTP ratio as the ratio of MTTP in the investigationarm to MTTP in the reference arm all measures in months,MST,MTTP,1
Association between the MST and MTTP Ratioin the FirstLine Chemotherapy Setting in theOverall CohortWe plotted the MTTP and MST ratios from all  trialsFigure ,MST,MTTP,1
 There was  moderate relationship between the TTPand OS differences with  higher MTTP ratio correlated with ahigher MST ratio univariate analysis R  ,OS,MTTP,1
We conducted  multiple linear regression analysis forthe MST ratio using several trial characteristics as independent variables including the MTTP ratio for all  trialsTable ,MST,MTTP,1
 Of these covariatesthe MTTP ratio was anindependent factor inuencing the MST ratio   ,MTTP,MST,1
 These suggest that the MST ratio was signicantly and primarilyexplained by the MTTP ratio rather than the other covariates,MST,MTTP,1
Association between the MST and MTTP Ratioin the FirstLine Chemotherapy Setting inSeveral SubgroupsTo investigate whether any of trial settings could affectthe relationship between the MST and MTTP ratios eligibletrial pairs were subdivided into several subgroups Table ,MST,MTTP,1
indicating that the MTTP ratio could explain one sixth to halfof the variance in the MST ratio,MTTP,MST,1
DISCUSSIONWe found in this study that the MTTP ratio independently affected the MST ratio in the multiple linear regressionanalysis for the  trial pairs using several trial characteristicsas independent variables Table ,MTTP,MST,1
 In contrast the degree of the association between the MST and MTTP ratios was moderate inthe overall cohort and various trial settings Table ,MST,MTTP,1

 Tissue wasnot available for KRAS testing in three patients one patient hadtissue sent but DNA could not be extracted,KRAS,DNA,0
 Another possible explanation is the presenceof  coexisting mutation such as  PIKCA or PTEN mutation which could interfere with the efcacy of getinib andeverolimus,PIK3CA,PTEN,1
  PIKCA mutation which can occur concomitantly with KRAS mutations  can lead to persistent activation of the PIKAkt pathway despite EGFR inhibition and hasbeen shown to confer resistance in vitro in getinibsensitivelung cancer cell lines,PIK3CA,KRAS,1
PTENdecient cell lines have been shown to be associated withresistance to EGFR inhibitors and  PTEN deciency couldlead to activation of the PIKAkt pathway and mTOR resistance by accumulation of phosphatidylinositol triphosphate and persistent signaling through Aktprotein kinase ,EGFR,PTEN,1
One especially valuable aspect of this trial is the availability of EGFR and KRAS mutation testing in the majority ofpatients which provides some insight into the mechanisms ofresponse,EGFR,KRAS,1
 It may be benecial to design trials testing agents thatblock different molecular pathways such as combination therapywith an mTOR inhibitor and  MAPK inhibitor MAPKERKkinase inhibitor or insulinlike growth factor receptor inhibitorwith or without EGFR inhibition,MAPK,EGFR,1
 Because currently there is no validated biomarkerpredictive of response to mTOR inhibitors additional molecular studies beyond EGFR and KRAS mutation status werenot investigated,EGFR,KRAS,1

 In addition the relationship between PTEN mutations and epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR KRAS and TP mutationshas not been investigated,PTEN,TP53,1
 Mutations of PTEN exons  EGFR exons  ERBB exons  and  KRAS exon and TP exons  were determined by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing,PTEN,EGFR,1
 Of the  tumors with PTEN mutations  case concurrently had anEGFR mutation and  cases had TP mutations,PTEN,TP53,1
 However PTEN mutations were not found in the tumorswith KRAS mutation,PTEN,KRAS,1
 Our ndings indicate that PTEN mutations are relatively common in NSCLC andthus analysis of PTEN mutations may facilitate  comprehensive understanding of the genetic alterationsrelated to the EGFR signaling pathway,PTEN,EGFR,1
 Therefore we searched for mutations of the PTEN genein  large number of NSCLCs and confronted PTEN mutations withthe EGFR ERBB KRAS and TP mutations in the same tumors,PTEN,KRAS,1
 Mutations of the EGFR exons  ERBBexons  and  TP exons  and KRAS exon  geneswere also examined using PCR and direct sequencing,EGFR,TP53,1
 Statistical analysisThe relationship of PTEN mutations with clinicopathologic characteristics and mutations of the EGFR ERBB KRAS and TP geneswas analyzed using either  chisquare test or Fisher exact test,PTEN,TP53,1
 Of the  tumors with PTEN mutations  case concurrently had an EGFR mutation and  cases had TP mutations,PTEN,EGFR,1
PTEN mutations were not found in the tumors with KRAS mutationTable ,PTEN,KRAS,1
Several studies have reported that  lossoffunction mutationin the LKB gene also known as serine threonine kinase  STK tumor suppressor gene responsible for negative regulation ofmTOR often occurs concurrently with  KRAS mutation in NSCLCwhereas mutations of LKB and KRAS genes are rarely found intumors with an EGFR mutation ,KRAS,EGFR,1
 Based on these observations ithas been suggested that in the tumors with an EGFR mutation thereis already activation of the PIKAKTmTOR pathway as well asthe KRASRAFMAPK pathway and thus an LKB or KRAS mutationmay not be required to further potentiate these signaling pathways,EGFR,KRAS,1
 In contrast to this suggestion in the present study PTEN mutations werenot found in tumors with  KRAS mutation,PTEN,KRAS,1
Mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase TK domain such as aninframe deletion in exon  and LR in exon  have beenreported to be associated with sensitivity to the EGFR TK inhibitorsgetinib and erlotinib ,EGFR,TK,1
 However it has been suggested thatpersistent activation of the PIKAKT pathway through loss ormutation of PTEN amplication of chromosomal loci encoding AKTor PIK or gainoffunction mutations in PICA might also havean impact on the response to EGFR TK inhibitors ,EGFR,TK,1
 Several studies have reported that the vast majority ofneversmokers with EGFR mutations respond to EGFR TK inhibitors whereas current smokers with EGFR mutations generally donot respond to EGFR TK inhibitors ,EGFR,TK,1
 Based on our nding thatPTEN mutations were only present in eversmokers PTEN mutations may contribute to resistance to EGFR TK inhibitors in currentsmokers with EGFR mutations,PTEN,EGFR,1
 PTEN regulates TP stability by counteracting thePIKAKTMDM pathway and maintains the highly acetylatedTP in  phosphataseindependent manner that enhances TPDNA binding ability ,PTEN,TP53,1
 However in the present study no significant relationship between mutations in the PTEN and TP geneswas observed,PTEN,TP53,1
 Considering that PTEN is required for  responseto EGFR TK inhibitors our ndings indicate that an evaluation oflossoffunction mutations in the PTEN gene is required for an optimal therapeutic approach for patients with NSCLC,PTEN,EGFR,1

 To develop new therapeutic strategies for NSCLC we investigated the interactionsbetween DHA and ABT in NSCLC cells harboring EGFR or RAS mutation,EGFR,RAS,1
Together DHA eectively inhibits STAT activity and modulates expression of Mcl Survivin and Bim therebysynergizing with ABT to trigger apoptosis in NSCLC cells harboring EGFR or RAS mutation,STAT3,EGFR,1
 Our dataprovide  novel therapeutic strategy for EGFR or RAS mutant NSCLC treatment,EGFR,RAS,1
EGFR is  receptor tyrosine kinase that activates cellular signalingpathways such as the PIKAKT STAT and MAPK pathways and leadsto enhanced cell proliferation and migration,EGFR,MAPK,1
The oncogenes KRAS HRAS and NRAS are founding members of theRAS superfamily of GTPases,HRAS,NRAS,1
 Therefore it is critically important to develop new therapies forNSCLC patients with EGFR and RAS mutation,EGFR,RAS,1
 These molecular targets of DHA are frequently activatedby EGFR or RAS mutation in NSCLC ,EGFR,RAS,1
 Cell cultureEGFRmutant H HCC H H KRASmutantA H NRAS mutant H and BRAF mutant MV celllines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ATCC,NRAS,BRAF,1
 DHA enhances ABTinduced apoptosis in NSCLC cells with EGFRor RAS mutationTo examine the interaction between DHA and ABT in NSCLCcells with EGFR or RAS mutation H and A cells were selectedfor cotreatment analysis,RAS,EGFR,1
To further analyze that the synergistic cell cytotoxicity caused bythe cotreatment of DHA and ABT is not  cell linespecic phenomenon cells with EGFR RAS or BRAF mutation were investigated,RAS,BRAF,1
 Among them H cells harboring the NRAS mutationQK and MV with BRAF mutation VE were also sensitive tocotreatment Fig,NRAS,BRAF,1
 IMR an immortalized but nonmalignant lungcell line was resistant to combination treatment indicating that thecotreatment of DHA and ABT can eectively trigger apoptosis inNSCLC cells carrying EGFR or RAS mutation,EGFR,RAS,1
 STAT is inactivated by DHA in NSCLC cells with EGFR or RASmutationBcl family members are downstream eectors of multiple kinasesincluding PIKAKT MAPK or STAT signals ,STAT3,EGFR,1
Based on the phosphokinase array results other protein kinasessuch as HSP p AKT and ERK were also investigated by immunoblotting analysis,AKT,ERK,1
 STAT is inactivated by DHA in NSCLC cells with EGFR or RAS mutation,STAT3,EGFR,1
 H A and H cells were treated with DHA  M ABT  M alone or in combination for one day and the phosphoSTAT Y and total STAT were analyzed byWestern blotting,ABT,STAT3,1
  STAT was knocked down by shRNA or  in the presence or absence of stattic andH cells were treated with DHA  M ABT  M alone or comb for  day,STAT3,ABT,1
  H and A cells transfected with the constitutively active form of STAT STATCA or empty vector vector were treated with DMSO orcomb of DHA and ABT for  day and the cell apoptosis rates were examined left,STAT3,ABT,1
To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which STAT was inactivatedthe phosphorylation of JAK EGFR and Bmx was investigated,STAT3,EGFR,1
 Taken together the above data indicate that STAT inactivation by DHA contributes to ABT and combination treatmentinduced cell killingand JAK inactivation by DHA might mediate the inactivation ofSTAT,STAT3,JAK2,1
 DiscussionNSCLC cells usually harbor EGFR or RAS mutation,EGFR,RAS,1
 Inthe present study we investigated the antitumor eects of DHA andABT in NSCLC cells especially with EGFR or RAS gene mutation,EGFR,RAS,1
As  member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family Survivinexpression is frequently elevated in human cancers due to various stimuli such as EGFR mutation  and STAT constitutive activation,EGFR,STAT3,1
 STAT phosphorylation at Y can be triggered by the JAK family and by receptor ornonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR  SRC  and Bmx,STAT3,JAK,1
 Those data suggest that DHA mightinactivate STAT by inhibiting JAK activities,STAT3,JAK2,1
 Inour system we took advantage of specic JAK or STAT inhibitors tomimic DHA function on STAT,JAK2,STAT3,1

 We found that OT allosterically interacted with the STAT DNA binding site near the SHdomain with DG of ,STAT3,DNA,1
  Docking study of OT to the STAT DNA binding domainDBD,STAT3,DNA,1
 To conrm the effect of OT on downstreamtransactivation we analyzed DNA binding afnities of STAT usinga TransAM binding assay which showed  signicant inhibition ofthe binding activity from  mM of OT treatment with IC valueof  mM Fig,DNA,STAT3,1
 OTtriggered abrogation of STAT phosphorylation isregulated by SOCS and PIASAs OT inhibited STAT phosphorylation and transactivationpotential in KRAS mutant lung cancer cell lines we next evaluatedprotein expression levels of STAT regulators to elucidate themechanism of OTmediated STAT inhibition,STAT3,SOCS3,1
 Results show that  mM of OTincreased SOCS and PIAS levels in the cytoplasm and nucleusby ,SOCS3,PIAS3,1
 We thenhypothesized that OTinduced SOCS and PIAS expressioncontributed to STAT inhibition independent of other enzymaticregulators,SOCS3,PIAS3,1
To investigate the impact of SOCS and PIAS on proliferationand survival of A cells we used siRNA directed against theseproteins,SOCS3,PIAS3,1
 Inagreement with these results  combination of OT with siRNAsagainst SOCS or PIAS did not lead to increased levels of inhibitioncompared to OT treatment alone Supplementary Fig,SOCS3,PIAS3,1
 As it is wellknown that oncogenic KRAS upregulates expression of prosurvival Bcl genes weinvestigated the expression levels of another STAT target genesMcl and BclxL,KRAS,STAT3,1
 Graphs of relative STAT DNA binding afnity was obtained by STAT TransAM assay,STAT3,DNA,1
  Total proteins were isolated and analyzed by Western Blot for STAT regulator protein expressions including Srcy Abl PPA SHP and PTEN,STAT3,PTEN,1
  Cytoplasmic and Nuclear fraction were isolated and analyzed by Western Blot for SOCS and PIAS expressions,SOCS3,PIAS3,1
 Histogram of cytoplasmic SOCS was normalized by tubulin  and Nuclear PIAS wasnormalized by lamin  ,SOCS3,PIAS3,1
 Here considering that single treatments of OTdid not reduce Mclor even induced BclxL expression levelsthen we hypothesized that targeting of both STAT and Bclfamily proteins BclxL or Mcl in KRAS mutated lung cancersmight provide  synergistic therapeutic effect,STAT3,KRAS,1
 According to thepreviously data KRAS mutations can stimulate BclxL expressionthrough STAT activation to trigger drug resistance and antiapoptotic signaling ,KRAS,STAT3,1

 Moreover in the present study thehaplotype TT in the order of T and CT showed  nonsignicant trend for  worse treatment response compared withthe most common haplotype CC see Supplementary Tables  andTable Association between ABCC haplotypes and grade  or  hematologic toxicity selected by female,CC,ABCC2,1
 Moreover besides export ofanticancer drug like platinum overexpression of ABCC is associated with decreased platinumDNA adducts and this decreasein DNA platination was accompanied by an accelerated reentryinto the cell cycle after the typical cisplatininduced G arrest anda resistance to undergo apoptosis in cisplatinresistant cell lines,ABCC2,DNA,1
 An alternative explanation for the T variant allele carrierswith worse response is that T decreasing the ABCC expressionmay lead to  converse upregulation of the ABCB gene productPgp which is  critical member of multidrug resistance family,ABCC2,ABCB1,1

 Three different research groups have presented studies showinga positive relationship between the presence ofactivating mutations in the EGFR TK domain and aclinical response to gefitinib,EGFR,TK,1
 EGFR mutations LR and delLPinsS had increased TK activity compared withwildtype receptors and were more sensitive to inhibition by gefitinib,EGFR,TK,1
 These data suggested that adenocarcinomas from neversmokers comprise  distinctsubset of lung cancers frequently containing mutations within the TK domain of EGFR that areassociated with gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivity,TK,EGFR,1
 In this study we conducted  retrospective reviewof the  consecutive patients who underwent RC and the consecutive patients who had responded to rstline therapy andreceived DOC as the secondline therapy and compared the clinicaloutcomes between the two treatment groups,RC,DOC,1

These were signicantly better than in the DOC group althoughmore stage IV patients were included in the RC group,DOC,RC,1

 Analysis of the levels seen before and during radiotherapy levels for LRG LBP and CRP in adenocarcinoma and small celllung cancer showed no signicant difference in values Fig,LBP,CRP,1

 Acute Phase Response in Isolation is Unlikely to be Responsible forElevation of the Putative Biomarkers LBP and CRPTo understand the biological process that may cause or be related tothe changes observed in b mo survival patients in response to radiotherapy we analysed the contexts in which CRP and LBP may change,LBP,CRP,1
 In the acute phase response CRP and LBP areboth potentially regulated by changes in the levels of Interleukin  IL Ganapathi et al,CRP,LBP,1
 The level of IL wasavailable for eight of the squamous cell carcinoma patients during treatment and so its correlation with CRP LRG and LBP was investigatedduring radiotherapy,LRG1,LBP,1
 These two markers were identied bysubjective choice of candidate proteins and so it would be of interestto see if LRG and LBP levels during radiotherapy would add to thismodel,LRG1,LBP,1
 Measurement of IL in the plasma of the patients during radiotherapy inour study showed some correlation with the level of CRP and LRGbut not LBP,CRP,LBP,1
 With our ndingsmore investigation is required into whether CRP and LRG levelsalone can be independent predictors of survival or whether  panel including IL would have greater predictive ability,CRP,LRG1,1
 and so it would be interesting to see if CRP and LRG modulation in plasma could indicate radiotherapy linked toxicity,CRP,LRG1,1

 By contrast phosphorylation of EGFR B and B HER Band B and RYK F and F were upregulated with pacritinib,EGFR,HER2,1
 Pacritinib is  o nM IC inhibitor of both JAK and FLT and theircommon mutations and is at least fold less potent against JAK,JAK2,FLT3,0
 FLT inhibition bythe pacritinib occurred independently of JAK inhibition and alsosuppressed downstream STAT AKT and ERK ,FLT3,JAK2,1
 It is likely that interactions with one or more of these kinases may have been responsible for AKT and ERK inhibition,AKT,ERK,1
 MET interacts with several molecules including PIK SRC the growth factor receptorboundprotein  Grb SH domaincontaining transforming protein ShcGrbassociatedbinding protein  Gab and STAT by the SHdomain located in their carboxyterminal tail ,MET,STAT3,1
 described that HGF induced STAT phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT,HGF,STAT3,1
 recently reported thatmesenchymal stromal cellssecreted HGF and expanded myeloidderived suppressor cells through MET and STAT phosphorylation ,HGF,MET,1
In our resistant cell line PCER we postulate that pacritinib directly andor indirectly downregulated MET phosphorylation andsubsequently suppressed downstream ERK AKT and STAT activationresulting in the inhibition of tumor growth,MET,STAT3,1
 Thus the other mechanismssuch as CLK and the indirect downregulation of MET may bemore important than the JAK effect for pacritinib,CLK4,JAK2,1
 The inhibition was not mainly mediatedvia JAK inhibition and likely resulted from inhibition of one of theother kinase pathways such as CLK with multiple downstream interactions that have been identied as anticancer targets,JAK2,CLK4,1

 The phosphorylation of colin by OPN was suppressedwhen cells were pretreated with ROCK inhibitor Y by Western blot,OPN,ROCK,1
 OPN induced the phosphorylation of FAK and AKT,OPN,AKT,1
 OPN caused  signicant increase in the lamellipodiaformation and cell invasion and these are suppressed by FAK inhibitor FAKi PIK inhibitor wortmannin and ROCK inhibitor Y,OPN,ROCK,1
 Taken together these results suggest that OPN triggers ROCK signalingmediated by FAKPIKAKT pathway which in turn induces the lamellipodia formation to allow the invasion of lung cancer cells through inactivating colin,OPN,ROCK,1

 Because pactivated kinases PAKs and ROCK areresponsible for LIMKs phosphorylation and activation to investigate the upstream effectors of LIMKcolin the expressions ofPAKs and ROCK were evaluated by Western blot analysis,ROCK,ROCK1,1
 Asshown in Figure B OPN markedly increased the expression ofROCK in  dose dependent manner whereas PAK phosphorylation and PAK expressions remained unchanged,OPN,PAK1,1
 As shown in Figure C OPN increased the phosphorylationof colin which was effectively decreased by ROCK inhibitor,OPN,ROCK,1
Consistent with Figure  OPN increased ROCK expression andinactivated colin by phosphorylation in all NSCLC celllinesFig,OPN,ROCK1,1
Previous studies showed that FAK PIK and AKT signaling pathways contribute to the migration and invasion of cancer cellsmedicated by OPN,AKT,OPN,1
 Treatment of Acells with OPN led to  signicant increase of the phosphorylationof FAK and AKT without any effect on total FAK and AKT Fig,OPN,AKT,1
In conclusion we demonstrate that OPN effectively inhibitscolin activity through ROCK signaling which is mediated byFAKPIKAKT pathway,OPN,ROCK,1

 TDP has incell line based assays been shown to counteract the effect of CPT,TDP1,CPT,1
We have quantied the enzymatic activities of TOP and TDP in paired tumor and adjacent nontumor samples from nonsmall cell lung cancer NSCLC patients and show that in NSCLC TOP and TDP activities are signicantly upregulated in the tumor tissue,TOP1,TDP1,1
 Furthermore we found  positive correlation between the TDPactivity and the tumor percentage TOP activity did not correlate with the tumor percentage as well as betweenthe activities of TOP and TDP both within the tumor and the nontumor group,TOP1,TDP1,1
 This could be to protect against TOP mediated DNA damage asthe activity of TOP likewise was upregulated in the majority of tumor samples and correlated positively to theTDP activity,TOP1,DNA,1
 Regardless the nding that the TOP and TDP activities are upregulated and correlate positivelysuggests that combinatorial treatment targeting both activities could be advantageous in NSCLC,TOP1,TDP1,1
 KRAS or EGFR Roberts andStinchcombe  promoter methylations MLH or MGMT Doet al,KRAS,EGFR,1
These drugs target topoisomerase  TOP activity specically and function by converting intracellular TOP activity into DNA damage ultimatelykilling the cell Eng et al,TOP1,DNA,1
 Despite this knowledgeno preselection of patients with regard to TOP activity status is currentlyperformed before CPT based treatment is commenced,TOP1,CPT,1
TOP is an essential nuclear enzyme important for the release of topological stress introduced during processes such as transcription andreplication where the DNA double helix is locally unwound,TOP1,DNA,1
 Its catalyticactivity involves the transient cleavage of one strand in the DNA doublehelix causing TOP to be covalently attached to the DNA release of supercoils through rotation of the cut strand around the scissile strandand subsequent religation and release of the DNA Champoux ,DNA,TOP1,1
  and was initially discovered by its ability to remove TOP covalently trapped to the DNA by cleaving the phosphotyrosyl linkage in TOPDNA complexes Yang et al,TOP1,DNA,1
In human cells TDP is required for repair of chromosomal singlestrand breaks arising independently of DNA replication from abortiveTOP activity or oxidative stress ElKhamisy et al,TDP1,DNA,1
 Furthermorestudies have shown that TDP can remove several different moietiesfrom the end of DNA Huang et al,TDP1,DNA,1
  suggesting the importanceof TDP for the repair of  number of DNA lesions other than TOPDNA complexes Ben Hassine and Arcangioli  Das et al,TDP1,DNA,1
 However high TDP activity may counteractCPT induced DNA damage Barthelmes et al,TDP1,DNA,1
 TOP and TDP are ubiquitouslyexpressed in several human tissues Fam et al,TOP1,TDP1,1
  we examined the activities of TOP and TDP incryosections from  paired tumor and adjacent nontumor NSCLCtissues,TOP1,TDP1,1
 We found that both TOP and TDP were upregulated in thetumor tissue compared to the adjacent nontumor tissue in NSCLC,TOP1,TDP1,1
 Lastly we found  positive correlation between the activities of TOP and TDP suggesting that combinatorial treatmenttargeting both TOP and TDP could be desirable,TOP1,TDP1,1
 Synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and chemicalsAll oligonucleotides were obtained from DNA Technology  Aarhus Denmark except the TOP nanosensor TOPId which was obtained from Sigma Aldrich Broenby Denmark,DNA,TOP1,1

 To test the sensitivityof the TDP and TOP nanosensors in cryosections from the NSCLC tissue we performed activity measurements in extract from sections corresponding to  thickness of  m  m  m    m and  m   m Fig,TDP1,TOP1,1
 Furthermore thisamount of tissue resulted in measurements well above the sample without tissue and should therefore enable TDP and TOP measurementseven in samples with low enzyme activity Fig,TDP1,TOP1,1
 Illustration of how the TDP and TOP measurements in cryosections are performed,TDP1,TOP1,1
 The sections in between are dissolved in  TDP buffer divided intothree aliquots and used for determining the protein concentration by photospectrometric measurement for measuring the activity of TDP using the TDP nanosensor and TOPusing the TOP nanosensor,TDP1,TOP1,1
  The TDP nanosensor is composed of  DNA oligonucleotide labeled with an ATTO uorophore in the end marked with an  and  BHQ quencherin the end marked with  ,TDP1,DNA,1
  The TOP nanosensor is composed of  DNA oligonucleotide designed to adopt  dumbbell structure consisting of  stretch of doublestranded DNA connected by two loops holding  sequence identifying the substrate marked Id and aprimer binding sequence marked ,TOP1,DNA,1
 Upon addition of the TOP nanosensor to the tissue extract the endogenous TOP cleaves the nanosensor releasing three bases of DNA shown inred from the end,TOP1,DNA,1
 Sensitivity of the TDP and TOP nanosensors in cryosections,TDP1,TOP1,1
 Correlation between the activities of TDP and TOP in NSCLCSince the activity of both TDP and TOP was upregulated in thetumor samples compared to the nontumor samples in NSCLC and thefact that TDP initially was discovered by its ability to remove TOPcovalently trapped to the DNA we speculated if there could be  correlation between the two enzyme activities,TDP1,TOP1,1
 Thus we compared the activity of TDP and TOP and found  positive correlation both in the tumorsamples   ,TDP1,TOP1,1
 This was done by dividing the TDP and TOP activity measured in the tumor sample with the activity measured incorresponding nontumor sample of the individual patients,TDP1,TOP1,1
 between thechange in TDP activity and change in TOP activity Fig,TDP1,TOP1,1
 DiscussionIn the present study we examined the activities of TOP and TDP incryosections from NSCLC tissue samples,TOP1,TDP1,1
 Most of the knowledge aboutenzyme activities such as TOP and TDP comes from studies basedon cell lines,TOP1,TDP1,1
 Both TDP and TOP havebeen reported to be posttranslational modied Bandyopadhyay andGjerset  Chiang et al,TDP1,TOP1,1
 Herewe demonstrated that the sensitivity of the nanosensors used allowsprecise measurement of both TOP and TDP activities in cryosectionsdown to  m thickness Fig,TOP1,TDP1,1
 However we would suggestto use thicker sections we used    m since this will maximizethe chance of getting precise activity measurements in samples withlow TOP and TDP activities and the nal concentration of OCT compound should be kept below  to avoid it from inuencing the measurements Fig,TOP1,TDP1,1
  and high TDP activity have been reported tocounteract CPT induced DNA damage Barthelmes et al,TDP1,CPT,1
 From  biological point of view it would make sensethat increased TOP activity would require increased DNA repair capability,TOP1,DNA,1
 Although different repair pathways are involved in the repair ofTOP induced DNA damage the importance of TDP is illustrated bythe fact that cells from SCAN patients homozygote for the AG mutation and TDP decient mouse cells are hypersensitive to CPT Hiranoet al,DNA,TDP1,1
 Due to thefunctionally linked activities we speculated if there could be  positivecorrelation between TOP activity and TDP activity in the tested tissuesamples,TOP1,TDP1,1
 Despite the limited number of samples included we found aclear positive correlation between the TOP and TDP activities bothin the tumor   ,TOP1,TDP1,1
 when comparing the change in TDP activity andchange in TOP activity thus the difference in activity in the tumorand nontumor samples from the individual patients,TDP1,TOP1,1
 What causes thiscorrelation is unknown however it is intriguing to speculate if it is aconsequence of  controlled feedback mechanism either directlywhere high TOP activity causes increased TDP activity or indirectlyif TOP and TDP shares common regulators of expression or activity,TOP1,TDP1,1
 Dual inhibitors targetingboth TDP and TOP have been reported CondaSheridan et al,TDP1,TOP1,1
 Since thereare no TDP inhibitors currently approved for use in patients  possibility could be to combine CPT with PARP inhibitors as previously suggested Gilbert et al,TDP1,CPT,1
  however phase  study in refractory solid tumors and lymphomas examiningcombined treatment with CPT and PARP inhibitors was terminated before time due to toxicity Kummar et al,CPT,PARP,1
In summary we have used our previously published nanosensors tomeasure the enzymatic activity of TOP and TDP in cryosections fromNSCLC patients,TOP1,TDP1,1
 We founda positive correlation between the TOP and TDP activities both inthe tumor   ,TOP1,TDP1,1
 Correlation of the measured TDP and TOP activities in tumor and nontumor samples from NSCLC patients,TDP1,TOP1,1
  Correlation of the measured TDP and TOP activities in the tumorsamples,TDP1,TOP1,1
  Correlation of the measured TDP and TOP activities in the normal samples,TDP1,TOP1,1
  Correlation of the change in activity thus  of TDP and TOP,TDP1,TOP1,1
 Since  correlation between the activities of TOP and TDP was found both in the tumorand the nontumor group it is tempting to speculate that it could bethe result of coregulation of the activities and thus present in othertypes of tissues and cancers however this remains to be examined,TOP1,TDP1,1

 In light of an effect on asignicantly different sunitinibtreated mRCC population  moreunifying hypothesis for impairing PFS and OS outcomes is aninteraction between AS therapy and TKIs,OS,AS,1
In this retrospective analysis use of AS was strongly associatedwith poorer PFS and OS,AS,OS,1
PFS and OS between the AS and no AS groups were smallsignicantly greater ORR presence of TKIrelated rash andtreatmentlimiting toxicity might further imply this difference isrelated to drug exposure,OS,AS,1
 limitation of our study is the inability to compare patients withactivating EGFR mutations between the AS and no AS groups,EGFR,AS,1
 Although erlotinib is dosed at its MTD thepresence of an EGFR mutation might allow much lower erlotinibdoses than are standard to be effective thereby circumventingreduced erlotinib absorption caused by AS therapy,EGFR,AS,1

 PET imaging also has been noted to reduceinterobserver variation when used to guide target volume delineation in RTP in NSCLC patients ,PET,RTP,1
 number of techniques have been used to generate RTP targetvolumes using the information gleaned from PET and CT,RTP,PET,1
 When used in its most basic form without specic adaptations for RTP images from  staging PETCT scan can be visuallycorrelated with the RTP CT to identify areas of disease for inclusionwithin the treatment volume,RTP,CT,1
 However most staging scans are acquired on  curvedtop couch possibly with the patient arms positioned down bytheir side while an RTP CT is usually acquired on  at top CTcouch with arms immobilized above the patient head,RTP,CT,1
 The use of deformable registration to combine  diagnosticPETCT scan with an RTP CT scan has not been consistently validated and at present is not recommended for this purpose ,RTP,CT,1
In conclusion there are no validated strategies available thatwould allow the use of  diagnostic PETCT for reliable imagefusion with an RTP CT,RTP,CT,1
 It requires  complete RTP procedure onthe PETCT scanner for all potential candidates for radical irradiation despite the fact that  signicant number of patients will beclassied with stage IV disease after interpreting the PET images,RTP,PET,1
 This includes patient preparation scan acquisition review ofthe images acquired the alignment of the CT and PET componentsof the PETCT scan transfer of the images to the radiotherapyplanning system and the nal display of the PETCT images onthe planning computer,CT,PET,1
Where  PETCT scan is not acquired in the RTP positionWhere the PETCT used for interpretation has not been acquiredin the treatment planning position and is only visually comparedwith  D radiotherapy planning CT PET should only be used toidentify those tissues which contain tumor,RTP,PET,1
 The RTP CT should beused when delineating the edge of the GTV and lymph nodes ,RTP,CT,1
Where  PETCT scan is acquired in the RTP position withoutrespiration compensationStandard CT for RTP is acquired during free breathing withoutspecic measures for compensation of breathing motion resultingin deformation and misplacement of tumor locations,RTP,CT,1
Where  PETCT scan is acquired in RTP position with breathingcompensationWhere adequate respiration compensation is used in thetreatment planning CT such as with DCT the CT images mayprovide reliable information on the shape and location of tumorsites exceptin cases where there is insufcient contrastbetween tumor and nontumor tissues for example where thereis atelectasis or postobstructive pneumonia Fig,RTP,CT,1
 For image fusion of PET with CT use  linear scale to one or at most two colors ,PET,CT,1
 CT images show insufcient contrast between tumor and nontumor tissue where atelectasis is present thereforedelineation should be dened by PET FDG avid areas,CT,PET,1
An important question is whether the GTV or reGTV may contain areas where PET is positive for tumor but CT shows normal lungtissue,PET,CT,1
 Another difculty with PET based autocontouring is the variability of SUV values due to factors other thantumor activity such as patient biological factors and technical factors ,PET,SUV,1
 Furthermore the information obtained fromthe PET component of the scan is complementary to that containedwithin the CT scan and the use of information from both may leadto more successful autocontouring ,PET,CT,1
 In D PETCT imaging the CT componentis acquired as fast CT which may catch  mobile lung tumor atan extreme of the ITV or cause artefacts while PET scans areacquired over  number of minutes,CT,PET,1
Hence in essence for mobile lung tumors the PET component ismore akin to D imaging while the CT component is more akinto  D imaging technique,PET,CT,1
the SUV overthatCTV and PTV expansions to  PET derived GTVThese guidelines have focused on the delineation of standardized GTV or reGTV contours,SUV,PET,1
PET combined with MR imagingWhen envisioning the future it is interesting to follow therecent advances in hybrid imaging systems which made it possibleto combine PET and functional MR information,PET,MR,1
 With thecombination of functional MR and PET information new possibilities in functional cancer imaging are emerging ,MR,PET,1

 However the details of the molecular mechanisms involved arepoorly understood and even less is known about the functions of LRIG and LRIG,LRIG2,LRIG3,1
 Expressionlevels of LMO and LIMCH in normal and malignant lung tissue were investigated using qRTPCR and throughin silico analyses of public data sets,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
Results In the yeast twohybrid screen the two paralogous proteins LMO and LIMCH were identified asinteraction partners to LRIG,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 LMO and LIMCH colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with both LRIG andLRIG,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Endogenously expressed LMO was in close proximity of both LRIG and LRIG,LMO7,LRIG1,1
 LMO and LIMCH werehighly expressed in normal lung tissue and downregulated in malignant lung tissue,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 LMO immunoreactivitywas shown to be  negative prognostic factor in LRIG positive tumors predicting poor patient survival,LMO7,LRIG1,1
Conclusion These findings suggest that LMO and LIMCH physically interact with LRIG proteins and thatexpression of LMO is of clinical importance in NSCLC,LMO7,LIMCH1,1

 Additionally LRIG can be proteolyticallycleaved at the ectodomain the soluble LRIG that is shed then negatively regulates EGFR signaling in  paracrine fashion ,LRIG1,EGFR,1
 The knowledge about LRIG and LRIG function is comparatively poor,LRIG2,LRIG3,1
 LRIG has been shown to directly interact with and oppose theaction of LRIG ,LRIG3,LRIG1,1
 Standard curvesfor LMO and LIMCH were prepared using in vitro transcribed RNA,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Expression levels of LMO and LIMCH were normalized toRNS,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
Thereafter the cloned LMO and LIMCH cDNAs were PCR amplifiedand subcloned into mammalian expression vectors,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 To this end thefollowing PCR primers were used LMO forward primer   AAGGTACCAGTTCAATATATGGGTACGGTC   LMO reverse primer  GAGGTACCCATGGCGGTTGGC   LIMCH forward primer  AAGGTACCATGGCTTGTCCCGCTCT   and LIMCH reverse primer  GGAGGTACCCAATGTTGTAGGCTGCCC  ,LMO7,LIMCH1,0
 DNA sequencing confirmed that LMO and LIMCH had been successfully cloned into thepMH and pcDNA,DNA,LMO7,1
 Thus the generated circular DNA was marked withfluorescence creating  fluorescent PLA spot for each detected interaction,DNA,PLA,1
 Tissuespecific LMO and LIMCH gene expression was visualized using datasets from the Human Protein Atlas HPA available at proteinatlas,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 LMO and LIMCH interacted with LRIG and LRIG as shown by YTH and coimmunoprecipitations,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
  COS cells were transfected with either LMO or LIMCH together with either LRIG or LRIGfollowed by lysis coimmunoprecipitation using antibodies against LRIG or LRIG and Western blotting,LMO7,LRIG1,1

 An LRIGderived peptide interacted with LMO and LIMCH peptidesin  YTH screenIn order to identify protein interaction partners to the LRIG proteins  YTH screen using  conserved LRIGderived peptide as baitand  human brain cDNA library was performed,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 The nucleotide sequences revealed that at least eight of the LMO clones and eleven ofthe LIMCH clones represented independent clones,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 The smallest baitdependent cDNA clones obtained for LMO and LIMCH encodedamino acids  NP and  NP respectively,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 All the LMO and LIMCH clones contained the completeLIM domain of respective protein,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 LMO and LIMCH coprecipitated with LRIG proteins in transfectedcellsCoimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed to investigatewhether LMO and LIMCH bind to the different LRIG proteins inmammalian cells,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 To this end COS cells were cotransfected withFLAGtagged LMO or LIMCH expression vectors in combination witheither LRIG LRIG or LRIG expression vectors,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Unfortunately in thissystem LRIG expression was consistently poor data not shown andtherefore the final experiments were performed using LRIG and LRIGonly,LRIG2,LRIG1,1
 Both LMO and LIMCH were expressed as multiple molecularspecies Fig,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
When LRIG was immunoprecipitated from cells cotransfected withLRIG and LMO or LIMCH  weak FLAGreactive band with an estimated molecular weight of  kDa corresponding to LMO herereferred to as LMO  or   kDa FLAGreactive band corresponding to  major band of LIMCH here referred to as LIMCH were reproducibly detected in the precipitates Fig,LRIG1,LMO7,1

 Thus both LRIG and LRIG showedprominent colocalization with LMO and LIMCH when ectopicallyexpressed in COS cells,LRIG1,LRIG3,1
 Endogenous LMO was in close proximity to LRIG and LRIG inH cellsPLA was used to investigate whether endogenous LMO interactswith LRIG or LRIG,LMO7,LRIG1,1
 The lung cancer cell line Hexpressed relatively high levels of LMO LRIG and LRIG data notshown and was therefore used to analyze endogenous protein interactions between LMO and LRIG and between LMO and LRIG,LRIG1,LRIG3,1

   LMO and LIMCH expression was analyzed through an in silico analysisof expression data from Human Protein Atlas HPA datasets,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
   Expression levels of LMO and LIMCH in NSCLC datasets from the TCGA database were compared to tumor adjacentnormal tissue,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Since LMO interacted physically with LRIG  KaplanMeier analysis stratified for LRIG status was also performed Fig,LMO7,LRIG1,1
Table Multivariate Cox regression analysisrisk of death for LMO immunoreactivity adjusted for LRIG status performance status clinical stagepatient age and sex,LMO7,LRIG1,0
 DiscussionIn this study we have shown that the paralogous proteins LMOand LIMCH interacted physically with both LRIG and LRIG LMOand LIMCH were highly expressed in normal lung tissue and LMOimmunoreactivity was  strong negative prognostic marker in LRIGpositive lung cancer,LIMCH1,LRIG1,1
Direct physical interactions of LMO and LIMCH with LRIG andLRIG were supported by four lines of experimental evidence,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 First inour YTH screen using  highly complex brain cDNA library  of the isolated baitdependent clones were derived from LMO or LIMCH,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
The high frequency of LMO and LIMCH among the YTH preys andthe fact that respective LIM domain was included in all of the LMOand LIMCHderived clones suggest that the interactions were not dueto random events,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Second LMO and LIMCH interacted with LRIG and LRIGin coimmunoprecipitation experiments when the proteins were overexpressed in COS cells,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Considering that the LRIG fragment chosenfor the initial YTH screen is conserved between the LRIG proteins it isperhaps not surprising that not only did LRIG interact with LMO andLIMCH but that also LRIG did so as well,LRIG3,LRIG,1
 Third LMO andLIMCH colocalized with LRIG and LRIG in various cellular compartments as assessed using confocal immunofluorescence microscopywhen the proteins were overexpressed in COS cells,LMO7,LRIG1,1
 Fourth usingPLA endogenously expressed LMO was also shown to be in closeproximity to endogenous LRIG and LRIG in H cells suggestingthat the interactions between the proteins are physiological,LMO7,LRIG1,1
LMO and LIMCH are paralogous proteins with terminal calponin homology CH domains and terminal LIM domains as well asthree other homologous regions of unknown function ,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Intriguingly transfection of cells with single LMO or LIMCH cDNAs also resulted inmultiple immunoblot bands suggesting that additional protein diversity may be generated from these two genes not only by alternativesplicing but also via other mechanisms such as alternative translationalstart sites or proteolytic processing,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Notably only some of the LMOand LIMCH molecular species interacted with LRIG and LRIG in ourcoimmunoprecipitation experiments,LIMCH1,LRIG1,1
 FurthermoreLMO LRIG and LRIG have all been shown to interact with EGFR aswell ,LRIG1,LRIG3,1
 Whether the interactions of LMO and LIMCH with LRIGproteins are important for the regulation of cell migration is not knownhowever it is notable that several studies have shown that LRIG alsoregulates cell migration ,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
The expression of LMO and LIMCH was particularly high in lungtissue but was detected in all the human tissues analyzed,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Theroles of LMO and LIMCH in cancer are not clear at the present time,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
Accordingly in the TCGA database both LMO and LIMCH weresignificantly downregulated in NSCLC compared to normal lung tissueNakamura et al,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Whether these observed downregulations reflect  defacto downregulation of LMO and LIMCH expression in the tumor celllineages or if they rather reflect  series of events where the cellsoforigin of the tumors express low levels of LMO and LIMCH alreadybefore their neoplastic transformations remains unknown because thecelloforigin of NSCLC in general and of the herein studied tumors inparticularis not firmly established at present,LMO7,LIMCH1,1
 Thus LMO interacted also prognostically with LRIG,LMO7,LRIG1,1
In summary LMO and its paralog LIMCH interacted with LRIGand LRIG in the YTH system and in mammalian cells,LMO7,LIMCH1,1

 Here we have proled seven smallmolecule inhibitorsincluding  that are approved drugs against  panel of clinically relevant mutations in ALK tyrosinekinase TK domain aiming at  comprehensive understanding of molecular mechanism and biologicalimplication underlying inhibitor response to ALK TK mutation,ALK,TK,1
 We nd that  the gatekeeper mutationLM causes crizotinib resistance by simultaneously increasing and decreasing the binding afnitiesof respectively ATP and inhibitor to ALK whereas the secondary mutation CY which is located faraway from the ATPbinding site of ALK TK domain causes the resistance by inducing marked allostericeffect on the site ii the nd and rd generation kinase inhibitors exhibit relatively high sensitivitytowards ALK mutants as compared to st generation inhibitors iii the pankinase inhibitor staurosporine is insensitive for most mutations due to its high structural compatibility and iv ATP afnity toALK is generally reduced upon most clinically relevant mutations,ATP,ALK,1
 In addition several ALK TK mutations suchas FL and RQ  have been reported to confer constitutive activation for the kinase to promote the development andprogression of NSCLC but these mutations were found to generallysensitize kinase inhibitors,ALK,TK,1
 In order toelucidate the molecular mechanism of inhibitor resistance andsensitivity we herein attempt to perform  systematic investigationof drug response to clinically relevant mutations in ALK TK domain,ALK,TK,1
 With this strategy we are able to prole seven ATPcompetitive ALK inhibitors including two FDAapproved drugs apankinase inhibitor staurosporine and four compounds that arecurrently under clinical or preclinical investigations as well as thenatural substrate ATP against  panel of  clinically relevantmutations in ALK TK domain,ALK,TK,1

 Here we performed QMMMPBSA calculations to investigate the structural and energeticproperty of drug interactions with ALK TK domain with respect tothe two mutations,ALK,TK,1
 As expected the secondary mutation LMwhich is also known as  gatekeeper mutation is located in theATPbinding site of ALK TK domain and thus can reshape geometryand property of the site Fig,ALK,TK,1
 Instead according to our calculations the gatekeeper mutation LM in ALK TK domain appearsto cause crizotinib resistance by simultaneously increasing anddecreasing the binding afnities of ATP and drug respectively andthe latter seems to be the primary factor of resistance establishment,ALK,TK,1
Another secondary mutation is the CY which locates at aloop region close to the aChelix motif that is far away from theATPbinding site of ALK TK domain Fig,ALK,TK,1
  The CY mutation addresses  signicant allosteric effect on the active site which induces considerable conformational changes in the aChelix and loop regionsof ALK TK domain thus breaking most established nonbonded interactions with ceritinib ligand,ALK,TK,1

 We found no studies that prospectively analysed immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with EGFRdriven or ALKdriven tumours although retrospective analyses suggest that tumours with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements EGFRALK respond less well to immunotherapy than tumours without EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations EGFRALK,EGFR,ALK,1

 Patients harboring EGFRgene mutations were excluded from EMLALK fusion genescreening on the basis of previous studies in which EGFR genemutations and the ALK fusion gene were reported to bemutually exclusive ,EGFR,ALK,1
 The presence of diffuse immunoreactivity which indicated that the fusion gene productwas observed in the cytoplasm also suggests that ALK wasfused with EML and the product was cytoplasmically localized in carcinoma cells Fig,ALK,EML4,1
 Similar to the case of EGFR TKIs inpatients with EGFRmutated NSCLC specic ALK inhibitorsevoked favorable responses in patients with NSCLC thatharbored the EMLALK fusion gene ,EGFR,ALK,1
Driver mutations including the EMLALK fusion geneEGFR gene mutation and the RET and ROS fusion geneswere recently discovered in NSCLC but the detection methods for driver mutations vary according to the type of drivermutation,RET,ROS1,1
 Therefore in future the ideal genetic screeningmethod for NSCLC without typical squamous cell featuresshould account for panscreening for novel biomarkersincluding the EMLALK fusion gene EGFR mutations andthe RET and ROS fusion genes regardless of age,EGFR,RET,1
 It is even more interesting that amongthe cases that it was possible to analyze for EGFR mutations median survival time MST was better in the casesthat had an EGFR mutation than in the cases that did notand this nding was observed both in the DTX group as wellas in the getinib group unpublished data,EGFR,DTX,1

   Active   RAC   pulldown   assay   indicated   that   overexpression   of   miRpcould   decrease   the   activity   of  RAC   with     higher   efciency   than   that   of  DOCK   knockdown,RAC1,DOCK3,1
In   conclusion   our   results   supported   that   miRp   could   inhibit   tumor   cell   adhesion   migration   andinvasion   by   regulating   the   RAC   activity   via   DOCK   in  NSCLC   A   and   H   cell   lines,RAC1,DOCK3,1

We   also  transiently  transfected  H  cells  with  pEGPHpRLTK  and  the  above  pGLWT  or  MT   DOCK  cidUTR  luciferasereporter  constructs,MT,DOCK3,1
  C  the  luciferase  activity  ofpGL  DOCK  cidUTR  site    WT   was  signicantly  inhibited  by  thepresence  of  pEGPH,DOCK3,WT,1
  The  luciferase  activity  reduction  in  cellscotransfected  with  pGL  DOCK  cidUTR  site    WT   and  pEGPHwas  about    of  what  was  observed  in  cells  cotransfected  withpGL  DOCK  cidUTR  site    MT   and  pEGPH,DOCK3,WT,1
  DOCK  knockdown  by  siRNA  also  caused  thesimilar  effects  on  RAC  expression  in  both  A  and  H  cellsbut  at  lower  efciency  about    compared  with  miRpoverexpression  Fig,DOCK3,RAC1,1
  Our  data  supportedthat  miRp  could  regulate  the  activity  of  RAC  at  least  partially  through  its  ability  to  downregulate  DOCK,RAC1,DOCK3,1
  DOCK  was   also  shown  to  interact  with  RAC  andinduce  GTP  loading  of  RAC  Namekata  et  al,DOCK3,RAC1,1
  reported  DOCK  could  activate  RAC  by  forming    complex  with  WAVE  and  thus  induce  cytoskeletal  reorganization  andchanges  in  cell  adhesion  Namekata  et  al,DOCK3,RAC1,1
  Taken  togetherthe  functional  analysis  of  miRp  and  DOCK  demonstratedthat  miRp  regulates  cell  adhesion  migration  and  invasionvia  RAC,DOCK3,RAC1,1
  CD  can  also  activate  RAC  and  induce  lamellipodium  outgrowth  by  binding  its  ligand  HA  Oliferenko  et  al,CD44,RAC1,1

 Together the results of this study suggestthat miR and its targets PHLPP and PHLPP play critical roles in NSCLC tumorigenesis andprovide potential therapeutic targets for NSCLC treatment,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 To overexpress PHLPP and PHLPP the PHLPPand PHLPP open reading frames were amplied and cloned intopcDNA vector Invitrogen,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 The predicted binding sites between miR and PHLPP and PHLPP UTRs are illustrated in Fig,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 Theexpression levels of PHLPP and PHLPP were obviously decreasedin A and H cells transfected with miR mimics but wereincreased after inhibition of miR Fig,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 Moreover theprotein levels of phosphorylated AKT were obviously increased inboth miRoverexpressing cell lines as  result of miR targeted reduction of PHLPP and PHLPP expression levels but weredecreased after inhibition of miR Fig,AKT,PHLPP1,1
 These results wereconsistent with the functions of PHLPP and PHLPP to dephosphorylate AKT directly ,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 To further determine if the suppressive effects of miR on PHLPP and PHLPP were directactions the fragments containing the miR binding sites ofthe wildtype and mutant UTRs of PHLPP and PHLPP weresubcloned into  luciferase reporter vector,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 DmiR suppressed PHLPP and PHLPP luciferase activities inA and H cells respectively which could be abrogated bymutations in the miR binding sites suggesting that miRdirectly targets PHLPP and PHLPP,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 Repression of PHLPP and PHLPP plays crucial roles in miRinduced proliferation of NSCLC cellsTo conrm whetherthe proliferationpromoting role ofmiR in NSCLC cells was attributable to decreased expressionof PHLPP and PHLPP we restored the expression of PHLPPand PHLPP in miRoverexpressing A and H cells bytransfection of PHLPP and PHLPP without the UTR Fig,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
MTT assay showed that reintroduction of PHLPP or PHLPP orboth signicantly decreased the growth rate of miRoverexpressing A and H cells Fig,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 These results demonstrate that repression of PHLPP and PHLPP plays  crucial role inthe miRinduced proliferation of NSCLC cells,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 PHLPP and PHLPP were downregulated in NSCLC specimensand inversely correlated with miR levelsWe further examined the expression levels of PHLPP andPHLPP in clinical NSCLC samples,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 Analyses of  sets of humanNSCLC and matched adjacent noncancerous lung tissues showedthat PHLPP and PHLPP expression levels were downregulatedin  high proportion of clinical samples  Fig,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 In addition correlation analyses revealed that miR levels were negatively correlated with PHLPP and PHLPP expression levels inNSCLC tissues Fig,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1

 Publiclyavailable bioinformatic algorithms predicted PHLPP and PHLPP astheoretical target genes of miR,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 PHLPP and PHLPP are antagonists of PIKAKT signaling and inhibit AKT signaling activity bydirectly dephosphorylating AKT which plays crucial roles in cellproliferation survival differentiation and migration ,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 Ourresults indicated that PHLPP and PHLPP expression weresuppressed by miR in NSCLC cells while inhibition of miR could rescue the expression of PHLPP and PHLPP,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 Luciferasereporter assays revealed that miR could directly target theUTRs of PHLPP and PHLPP mRNAs,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 Moreover reintroductionof PHLPP and PHLPP signicantly abrogated miRinducedproliferation of NSCLC cells,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 In clinical NSCLC tissues the expression levels of PHLPP and PHLPP were inversely correlated withmiR levels,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 Reintroduction of PHLPP andor PHLPP abrogated miRinduced proliferation of NSCLC cells,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
  Western blotting was used to detect the expression of PHLPP and PHLPP using GAPDH for normalization,PHLPP1,GAPDH,1

 Ourresults showed that PHLPP and PHLPP expression levels weredownregulated in NSCLC tissues compared with matched adjacentnoncancerous tissues,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 Reintroduction of PHLPP and PHLPP signicantly antagonized miRinduced proliferation of NSCLCcells suggesting that PHLPP and PHLPP function in inhibitingthe proliferation of NSCLC cells,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
 Furthermore miRinduceddownregulation of PHLPP and PHLPP signicantly increasedthe level of phosphorylated AKT conrming that miR activated AKT signaling thus modulating NSCLC cell proliferation,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1
In conclusion the results of this study suggest that miR isupregulated in NSCLC and plays an important role in the proliferation of NSCLC cells by targeting PHLPP and PHLPP,PHLPP1,PHLPP2,1

  ABSTRACT Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase NAMPT catalyzes the first ratelimiting step in converting nicotinamide to NAD essential for  number of enzymes and regulatory proteins involved in  variety of cellular processes including deacetylation enzyme SIRT which modulates several tumor suppressors such as p and FOXO,SIRT1,FOXO,1
 Herein we report that NQO substrates Tanshione IIA  TSA  and  lapachone  lap  induced    rapid  depletion  of  NAD  pool  but  adaptively    significant  upregulation  of  NAMPT,NQO1,NAMPT,1
 Compared with TSA or lap treatment alone cotreatment with FK induced  more dramatic depletion of NAD repression of SIRT activity and thereby the increased accumulation of acetylated FOXO and the activation of apoptotic pathway,SIRT1,FOXO1,1
 In conclusion the results from the present study support that NAMPT inhibition can synergize with NQO activation to induce apoptotic cell death thereby providing  new rationale for the development of combinative therapeutic drugs in combating nonsmall lung cancer,NAMPT,NQO1,1
 including through factors In  the  present  study  we  demonstrated  that  NAMPT inhibition  may  synergize  with  TSA  and  lap  in  inducing apoptotic  cell  death  of  nonsmall  lung  cancer  cells  thus providing    rationale  for  the  development  of  combination therapy  using  NAMPT  inhibitors  and  NQO  substrates  to enhance  sensitivity  andor  reduce  toxicity  in  therapy  of nonsmall lung cancer NSCLC,NAMPT,NQO1,1
 Results NAMPT  expression  is  adaptively  elevated  upon  NQO substrates exposure   major  cause  of  cell  death  caused  by  cell  stress  is thought to be the depletion of NAD from the nucleus and the  cytoplasm  ,NAMPT,NQO1,1
     NQO substrates exposure induced  significant increase in NAMPT mRNA expression,NQO1,NAMPT,1
 NAMPT inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to NQO substrates cytotoxicity The  upregulation  of  NAMPT  may  be  explained  by  an adaptivecompensatory response  of  cells  to  the  depletion  of NAD pool,NAMPT,NQO1,1
 Since FOXO is deacetylated by SIRT and its  deacetylated  form  carries  on  the  duty  to  transcribe  its downstream  target  genes  ,FOXO1,SIRT1,1
     Effects of NAMPT inhibitor FK on the cytotoxicity and apoptosis inducing effect of NQO substrates in A cells,NAMPT,NQO1,1
  This  observation  led  us  to examine  whether  NQO  targeting  agents  antitumor  can  be affected  by  regulating  NAD  especially  by  regulating NAMPT,NQO1,NAMPT,1
 We selected specific NAMPT inhibitor  FK    drug  in  several  phase    clinical  trials   whose antitumor activity has been reported in  broad range of  malignancies  to  facilitate  the  antitumor  effect  of  NQO substrates,NAMPT,NQO1,1
  As  potent  antitumor  candidate  biologically activated  by  NQO  TSA  and  lap  may  represent  NQO targeting  agents  which  arose  excessive  ROS  production  and induce  subsequent  cancer  cell  death,NQO1,ROS,1
  NQO  induced  cell apoptosis was characterized by excessive ROS production,NQO1,ROS,1

 BIM FasL TRAIL Bcl protein expression were assessed by western blot assay  modications and protein interactions and FOXO controlling intracellular ROS levels via antioxidative genes transcription ,FOXO,ROS,1
 We then looked into FOXO pathway in the investigation of the  mechanism  of  cell  apoptosis induced  by  NQO substrates  together  with  NAMPT  inhibitor,FOXO,NQO1,1
 The  depletion  of  NAD  level  and  reduced  SIRT  activity induced  by  NQO  substrates  which  may  count  for accumulation  of  FOXO  acetylation  and  the  following FOXO target  apoptotic  genes  activation  were  both enhanced  by  the  combination  with  FK,SIRT1,NQO1,1

MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy PopulationPatients  eligible  for  this  analysis  included  those  with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC who underwent genomic characterization of BRAF PIKCA and HER when added to the ongoing standard characterization of EGFR and KRAS from July   until August  ,HER2,EGFR,1
 During the study period EGFR and KRAS tumor genotyping were  considered  routine  clinical  tests  without  the  need  for patient  consent,EGFR,KRAS,0
  Specimens  were  analyzed  for  the  presence  of  somatic mutations  of  EGFR  exons    KRAS  exons    and   BRAF exons  and  PIKCA exons   and  and HER  exon    by  bidirectional  Sanger  dideoxyterminator sequencing  according  to  described  methods,EGFR,KRAS,1
 The  turnaround  time  was  calculated  for  BRAF  HER  and PIKCA mutational analysis specimens were most frequently also tested for mutations in EGFR and KRAS although in some cases mutational analysis of EGFR and KRAS had previously been  performed,PIK3CA,EGFR,1
 Of the  samples successfully tested for BRAF HER and PIKCA mutations   samples    were  also  successfully  tested  for  EGFR mutations   were successfully tested for mutations in KRAS and   underwent successful ALK testing,PIK3CA,EGFR,1
  Overall  we  identified  EGFR mutations in  of  specimens    KRAS mutations in  of  specimens   BRAF mutations in  of  specimens    HER mutations in  of   specimens      and  six  PIKCA  mutations  in  six  of  specimens ,EGFR,KRAS,1

  An yearold white female never smoker had adenocarcinoma that  harbored  an  EGFR  exon    deletion  and    PIKCA mutation before exposure to any systemic therapy,EGFR,PIK3CA,1
bThree patients had tumors bearing concurrent mutations in PIKCA and either KRAS    or EGFR    the demographics of the patient corresponding with each of the three tumor specimens were included and accounted for in the respective genotype cohort,PIK3CA,KRAS,1

 Correspondingly we categorized  specimens that were found to be wild type at all predefined exons of BRAF HER  and  PIKCA  as  inconclusive  because  they  contained less than  malignant cells,HER2,PIK3CA,1
 Similarly draft recommendations by the College of American Pathologists in conjunction with the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the Association for Molecular Pathology recommend  that  EGFR  and  ALK  testing  both  be  completed within  weeks  working days of receiving the specimen in  the  testing  laboratory,EGFR,ALK,1
 This is especially relevant as we identify more nonmutational genomic targets in NSCLC such as MET amplification and ROS and RET rearrangements,MET,ROS1,1
 These studies should help determine whether  targeted  therapeutic  strategy  will  result  in  improved  outcomes for  these  patients  analogous  to  those  observed  for  NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations or ALK translocations,EGFR,ALK,1

HDACi sensitizes NSCLC TICs to cisplatinHDACi has been reported to sensitize NSCLC bulk cells tochemotherapy which has been suggested to be the result ofthe increased accessibility of the DNA to cisplatin adductformation andor impaired function of DDR signaling  ,DNA,DDR,1
HDAC inhibitors alter DDR and survival in NSCLCTICs in response to ionizing radiationWe previously reported that NSCLC TICs are refractoryto irradiation and showed that NSCLC TICs have alteredirradiationinduced DDR signaling ,HDAC,DDR,1
 The spontaneous MN frequencieswere similar in both cell types ranging from  to  per BNC and were not affected by siRNA treatmentdata not shown,MN,BNC,1
The elegant aspect of the MN assay is that the level ofcytogenetic damage can be analyzed in relation to the cellcycle phase during which the DNA damage was induced inour design by irradiation,MN,DNA,1
In conclusionHKme has been suggested to regulate DDR by localization of TIP to sites of DNA damage ,DDR,DNA,1

Our interpretation is that the damage induction is superiorHeterochromatic NSCLC TICs are sensitive to HDACiin TICs than in bulk cells with HDAC inhibitors andor thatthe DNA repair capacity of TICs to some extent is blockedperhaps at  later stage than at  hour,HDAC,DNA,1

The results showed significantly positive correlationsbetween the intratumoral MVD and FGF expression inboth SQCC   ,MVD,FGF1,1

  The  difference  in  the  associationsbetween  NGB  and  MB   with  VEGFa  may   imply  that  different  regulatory  mechanisms  control  expression  of  these  two  globins,NGB,MB,1

 Approximately    to    of  patients  with  stage  IIIBIV NSCLC  have  doublenegative  tumors  without  either  an ALK  rearrangement  or  an  EGFR  mutation,ALK,EGFR,1
    recent study  found  that  high  expression  of  PTPRF  was  associated with decreased levels of phosphorylated EGFR in breast cancer  which  resulted  in  reduced  cell  invasion  migration  and metastasis,PTPRF,EGFR,1
Considering  the  role  of  PTPRF  in  the  modulation  of EGFR  signaling  and  its  carcinogenic  potential  plus  the  use of EGFRtargeted therapy in metastatic NSCLC  retrospective analysis was carried out to evaluate its potential as  predictive marker for treatment with erlotinib and to determine the prognostic role of PTPRF in NSCLC,PTPRF,EGFR,1
 OS also was improved with erlotinib versus placebo in the PTPRF high subgroup HR ,OS,PTPRF,1
Examining the PFS and OS outcomes for the placebo group demonstrates that high PTPRF expression is  potential prognostic marker for shorter OS respectively   ,OS,PTPRF,1
Analysis  in  the  confirmed  EGFR  wildtype  population found similar results for PFS and OS in the PTPRF high versus PTPRF low subgroups Fig,EGFR,OS,1
On the basis of the results from the translational analyses presented in this article of specimens obtained from clinical  studies  of  erlotinib  in  patients  with  advanced  NSCLC PTPRF  expression  above  the  median  appears  to  be    negative prognostic factor for OS in patients who have completed firstline  therapy  and  for  whom  treatment  with  erlotinib  is envisioned  although  no  prognostic  influence  on  PFS  could be discerned,PTPRF,OS,1
The presented analysis also suggests the hypothesis that PTPRF expression above the median may be  positive predictive factor for erlotinib treatment regardless of EGFR mutation status,PTPRF,EGFR,1
 If PTPRF expression is indeed independent of EGFR mutation status as suggested by the wildtype results in this analysis it may have value as  potential predictive marker for erlotinib Copyright   by the International Association for the Study of Lung CancerCopyright   by the International Association for the Study of Lung CancerJournal of Thoracic Oncology      Volume  Number  September  PTPRF Expression as  Marker for Erlotinib in NSCLCFIGURE ,PTPRF,EGFR,1

 Values represent relative PR expressionnormalized with GAPDH,PR,GAPDH,0
The PPD of PR is required for PRmediated inhibition of NSCLC cellproliferation in the absence and presence of progestinThe growth of NSCLC cells such as A cells is often dependentupon the activation of the EGFR signaling cascade which requiresPPDSH interactions to transmit downstream signals in cells,PR,EGFR,1
 Values represent relative PR expression normalized with GAPDH,PR,GAPDH,0
 EGFinduced ERK activation in Acells expressing PR was signicantly reduced in as few as  minwhile EGFinduced ERK activation in A cells expressing PRBSH showed prolonged ERK activation and did not show asignicant reduction in MAPK activation until  min after EGF treatment Fig,MAPK,EGF,1
 Thus it is likely that the PPD of PR may compete with otherPPDSH interactions that are important for intracellular signal transduction and the tracking of EGFR,PR,EGFR,1
 More studies will be neededto identify these important SH containing signaling molecules thatbind to the PR PPD and mediate PR inhibition of EGF signaling,PR,EGF,1
Previously we demonstrated that the PR PPD mediated progestindependent activation of Src and its downstream MAPK signalingin breast cancer cells ,PR,MAPK,1
 Faivre and Lange demonstrated thatrapid transient progestindependent activation of Src could leadto sustained MAPK activation by increasing EGFR expression andthe availability of EGF through PR transcriptional activities in breastcancer cells ,MAPK,EGFR,1
 We also identied the PR PPD  PXXPXRmotif as  crucial PR domain required for PRmediated inhibitionof NSCLC growth and EGF signaling thus suggesting that PR orthe PR PPD could have future therapeutic potential for NSCLC patients,PR,EGF,1

MCM is one of six MCM proteins composing the prereplicativecomplex that binds to replication origins in the G phase of thecell cycle and is essential for the initiation of DNA replication ,MCM4,MCM,1
After initiation of replication MCM proteins dissociate from theorigin and this prevents  second round of DNA replication fromthe same origin during the same  phase,MCM,DNA,1

 It may also resultfrom the different expression of DUSP and ERBB in SCC andAC demonstrated in our series  nding that we believe should betaken into account in formulation of prognostic risk scores,DUSP6,ERBB3,1
 Interestingly recent reports link high ERBB activity withresistance to therapies that target other members of the ERBB family inlung and breast cancers,ERBB3,ERBB,1
 The relatively weaker silencing of DUSP in ACmay reect the presence of alternative activating aberrations in AC egmutations in EGFR BRAF or AKT,DUSP6,AKT,1

Erlotinib and bortezomib may have complementary effectswith erlotinib blocking EGFR TK activity and bortezomib causingincreased degradation of activated EGFR by S proteasome inhibition and consequent reduction in antiapoptotic and proliferative signals generated by activated EGFR,EGFR,TK,1
Of particular interest is the simultaneous inhibition of HDAC andthe EGFR pathway,HDAC,EGFR,1
 Therefore EGFR mutation status may be predictiveof outcome with panobinostat and possibly other HDAC inhibitors,EGFR,HDAC,1

Methods We analyzed the data of NSCLC patients diagnosed from  to  who underwent reextesting for EGFR from  and ALK from  alterations and compared the outcome of those positive for the alterations against those who were wildtype WT,EGFR,ALK,1
 There were no signicant survivaldifferences in OS between positive and WT groups,OS,WT,1
Conclusion This study found signicant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics andtreatment outcomes between positive and WT patients for EGFR and ALK proles reinforcing the importance of reex testing in patient management,WT,EGFR,1
 Incontrast to the month overall survival OS of genetically unselected patients receiving conventional platinumbased therapypatients with EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma receiving EGFRTKI treatment have  median OS of more than  years ,EGFR,OS,1
We initiated reex EGFR analysis at the National Cancer CentreSingapore NCCS and Singapore General Hospital SGH in and added ALK uorescence insitu hybridization FISH in ,EGFR,ALK,1
The primary objectives of this study are to determine the demographic and treatment differences between those with alterationsof the EGFR or ALK gene versus those with wildtype and theimpact of reex molecular analysis on the treatment outcome ofthe patients,EGFR,ALK,1
 This resulted in  patients for the EGFR analysisand  patients for the ALK analysis,EGFR,ALK,1
 The extracted DNA underwent PCR amplication forEGFR exons    and   and the products were analysed by direct sequencing with ABI BigDyeTM terminator V,DNA,ABI,1
 We performedboth EGFR analysis and ALK FISH concurrently upon conrmationthat the histology was nonsquamous and likely of lung origin,EGFR,ALK,1
 Statistical analysisCategorical characteristics of patients with EGFR and ALK positive tumors were compared with those who had corresponding,EGFR,ALK,1
While patients in the ALK positive group had more lines ofpalliative treatment than the ALK wild type group there was nosignicant difference in OS between both groups Fig,ALK,OS,1
features management and subsequent outcome of treatmentsrendered between mutation positive and wild type patients forboth EGFR and ALK proles underpinning the importance of reextesting in patient management,EGFR,ALK,1
 In particular the study also draws an association between EGFR positivityand improved survival although this was not so for ALK fusion dueto the lower percentage of ALK positive patients receiving ALK TKItherapy,EGFR,ALK,1
 At this point however it is not clear if there are differencesbetween the EGFR and ALK positive groups due to the small samplesize of the latter,EGFR,ALK,1
Both EGFR and ALK mutations were previously shown to behighly predictive of response to their respective tyrosine kinaseinhibitors,EGFR,ALK,1

 Molecular indicators of prognosisinclude certain EGFR tyrosine kinase TK domain mutations predicting response to EGFR TK inhibitors TKIswhile mutations in the KRAS gene as well as at least oneEGFR gene mutation TM are predictors of EGFRTKI resistance e,EGFR,TK,1

 Only  smallfraction of EGFR mutations have been found outside exonslargecelle which encode part of the TK domain thatisfrequently activated by such mutations,EGFR,TK,1
In addition to TKactivating mutations EGFR mutationsconferring resistance to TK inhibitors TM have beenfound in e of AD SQ and adenosquamous carcinomas,EGFR,TK,1
 Fusion variants of EMLALKinvolve at least eight different EML exons and as in othertumors harboring ALK fusions invariably involve exon of ALK,EML4,ALK,1

The MEK kinase which is downstream of KRAS andBRAF may also play  role in NSCLC,MEK1,KRAS,1
Commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes in NSCLCinclude TP  CDKNA p  and LKBSTK ,TP53,CDKN2A,1
 TP mutations are moreor sclerosing BACscommonly found in the presence of EGFR mutations inindividuals who have never smoked neversmokers thanin those who have ever smoked eversmokers,TP53,EGFR,1
 LKB mutations were foundat  frequency of  in KRAS mutationepositive NSCLCtumors and in  of the  BRAF mutationpositive tumors inthe same study ,KRAS,BRAF,1
 Mutationsin KRAS are mutually exclusive to EGFR mutations andhave proven to be indicators of resistance to EGFRtargeted therapy ,KRAS,EGFR,1
 BRAF mutations have alsobeen shown to be mutually exclusive to EGFR and KRASmutations and are associated with resistance to EGFRtargeted therapies in colorectal cancer ,BRAF,EGFR,1
 Furthermore mutations of PIKCA and PTEN pathway geneshave been associated with resistance to antiEGFR therapies in colorectal and breast cancer respectively ,PIK3CA,PTEN,1
 In  cell line transformationstudy  selective MEK inhibitor was recently shown toinhibit MEK activation resulting from somatic mutationof MEK in lung AD ,MEK,MEK1,1
 For example in relation to downstreamactivation of the MEKERK MAPK pathway cancer cellswith activating KRAS mutations have been shown todemonstrate sensitivity to combinatorial EGFR and MEKinhibitors however cells harboring both PTEN and KRASmutations do not respond to this inhibition ,KRAS,EGFR,1
Conversely while BRAF and PIKCA have similar mutation frequencies in the different subtypes exon  of PIKCA is mutated more frequently in AD than SQ and exon of BRAF is mutated more frequently in SQ than AD,BRAF,PIK3CA,1
 For example KRAS mutations are stronglyassociated with mucinous BAC subtypes of AD whereasEGFR and TP mutations are associated with nonmucinous BACs,KRAS,TP53,1

 Several studies haveidentied some of the mechanisms involved in the development of AR to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitorsTKI that can be potential therapeutic strategies although in up to  of cases the underlying mechanism of AR are still unexplained,AR,EGFR,1
In this review we aim to summarize the main mechanisms of AR to EGFR TKI and some clinical strategies that can be used in the daily clinical practice to overcome this resistance and try to prolong the outcomes in this subgroup of patients,AR,EGFR,1
Several mechanisms of AR have been yet reported which couldbe grouped in four main categories rst the presence of secondarymutations in EGFR second the presence of parallel activation ofdownstream signalling pathways bypass tracks activation third phenomenon of  phenotypic transformation and fourth theoccurrence of genetic alterations in addition to the EGFR mutation,AR,EGFR,1
 RASmediated activation of the ERK kinases contributes to the proliferative activity of EGFR whereas activation of AKT is largely linked to an antiapoptotic function,ERK,AKT,1
 EGFRmutant patients with AR to EGFR TKI  CTscan and positron emission tomography PET imaging were performed at baseline after  period of  weeks free of TKI and after  weeks ofresuming the TKI,AR,EGFR,0
 The potential treatment strategies for EGFRmutant patients with AR to EGFR TKI are reviewed as well,AR,EGFR,1
Mechanisms of AR to EGFR TKI in EGFRmutant patientsPresence of secondsite mutations in EGFRThe threoninetomethionine mutation in codon  TMin exon  of the EGFR gene is the most common type of AR mutation observed,AR,EGFR,1
 Approximately  of cases with AR to EGFR TKItherapy carry  secondsite mutation TM gatekeeper mutation in the kinase domain of the EGFR that coexists with the EGFRactivating mutation ,AR,EGFR,1
The TM substitution alters the proper binding of the drug tothe ATP pocket of EGFR andor restores the afnity for ATP at thelevel of wildtype EGFR Fig,ATP,EGFR,1
 New irreversible EGFR TKI has  limited efcacy due to dosagelimitation related to the toxicity when WT EGFR is also inhibited,EGFR,WT,1

 Main mechanisms of AR to EGFR TKI in EGFRmutant NSCLC cells,AR,EGFR,1
The FLT receptor inhibitor an indolocarbazole compound is alsounder investigation as potent and reversible inhibitor of EGFRTM that spare WT EGFR in the context of TMmediated drugresistance in NSCLC ,FLT3,WT,1
 CO is an orally active TKI that targets common activating EGFR mutations and TM and preliminary results in  phase  trial NCT  exhibits tumorshrinkage  in EGFRmutant tumors and AR to EGFR TKI particularly in the treatment of TM positive disease ,EGFR,AR,1
Parallel activation of downstream signalling pathwaysOther mechanisms of AR to EGFR TKI consist of the activation ofparallel pathways in which the key downstream targets of EGFR areactivated independently of EGFR Fig,AR,EGFR,1
 These mechanisms include MET amplication and HGF overexpression,MET,HGF,1
 Amplication of the MET oncogene has been reported inapproximately  of NSCLC patients with AR to EGFR TKI,MET,AR,1
 Amplication of MET was originally identied in the resistantHCC cell line which harbours both the sensitive EGFR exon mutation and MET amplication and is resistant to getinibin vitro,MET,EGFR,1
 Its presence was associated with the developmentof AR to EGFR TKI suggesting that TKI might select for preexistingcells with MET amplication during the acquisition of EGFR TKIresistance ,AR,EGFR,1
MET amplication causes EGFR TKI resistance by activatingEGFRindependent phosphorylation of ERBB and downstreamactivation of PIKAKT pathway providing  bypass track even inthe presence of an EGFR inhibitor,MET,EGFR,1
 Thus concomitant inhibitionof both EGFR and MET would be required to overcome resistanceto EGFR inhibitors by MET amplication ,EGFR,MET,1
Although MET amplication can occur with the EGFR TMmutation about  of MET amplication is found withoutTM mutation,MET,EGFR,1
No recent clinical trials with MET inhibitors have been designedfor TKI resistant EGFRmutant NSCLC patients but concomitantinhibition of MET and EGFR pathway with MET TKI tivantinib or MET mAB onartuzumab  have been proved to be efcacious in phase II trials with unselected population,MET,EGFR,1
 MET and EGFR inhibition is being also tested in the ongoing clinicaltrialNCT  phase  study to evaluate the combination of theMET inhibitor crizotinib with the panERBB inhibitor dacomitinibin patients with NSCLC,MET,EGFR,1
  planned expansion cohort of this trialwill include patients with known AR to EGFR TKI,AR,EGFR,1
HGF overexpressionMET activation by its ligand hepatocyte growth factor HGFproduced by stromal as well as tumor cells also induces drug resistance to EGFR TKI in  dosedependent manner by restoring thePIKAKT signalling pathway via phosphorylation of MET throughGAB signalling but not EGFR or ERBB ,HGF,EGFR,1
 In some patients withpaired tumor specimens without evidence of EGFR TM or METamplication HGF expression was signicantly greater in resistantspecimen compared to pretreatment specimen   ,EGFR,HGF,1
In Asiatic population highlevel HGF expression TM mutation and MET amplication were detected in   and  of tumors with AR to EGFR TKI respectively,HGF,MET,1
 HGF expression wassignicantly higher in tumors with AR than in sensitive tumorsand  of tumors with AR simultaneously overexpressed HGFwith TM and MET amplication ,HGF,AR,1
In  recent trial in Asiatic population HGF measured by immunohistochemistry had  prognostic value and those patients withweak HGF expression tended to have lower year OS comparedwith those patients with HGF overexpression ,HGF,OS,1
 Other strategies target the Heat shockprotein HSP   molecular chaperone for several proteinsincluding EGFR and MET,EGFR,MET,1
  combination of AUY pluserlotinib is currently being tested in patients with AR to EGFR TKINCT and the preliminary RR is  ,AR,EGFR,1
  systematic rebiopsyprotocol in  EGFRmutant patients with AR to EGFR TKI identied the TM mutation as the most common mechanism of AR followed by HER amplication  small cell transformation  and MET amplication ,AR,EGFR,1
 In vitro the combination of  mutantselective EGFRTKI WZ and  METTKIE is effective against tumor cell lines refractory to erlotinibby inhibiting three different mechanisms the EGFR gatekeeperTM mutation MET amplication and HGF overexpression ,EGFR,MET,1
 The systematic genetic andhistological analyses of paired tumor biopsies from  patientswith drugresistant NSCLC carrying EGFR mutations showed thatthese transformed SCLC tumors express neuroendocrine markersmaintained the original EGFRsensitizing mutation and respondto standard SCLC chemotherapy but none demonstrated TMmutation or MET amplication but one patient acquired PIKCAmutation concomitantly with SCLCswitch ,EGFR,MET,1
 Ina phase II trial in nonmolecular selected population entinostatan HDAC inhihibitor combined with erlotinib after progressionto chemotherapy showed increased OS and PFS compared to erlotinib monotherapy in NSCLC tumors with high cadherin expression levels at time of diagnosis ,HDAC,OS,1
 An increase in activatedphosphorylated MEK and its downstream effector STAT has alsobeen reported in resistant lung cancer cells with MET,MEK,MET,1
 Recently it has beenrecently described that activation of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase by overexpression or upregulation of its ligand GAS confersAR to EGFR TKI in preclinical models,AXL,EGFR,1
 Approximately  ofthe EGFR TKI resistant tumors show increased AXL expression incooccurrence with TM but not MET overexpression ,EGFR,AXL,1
 ThusAXL inhibitors such as SGI might be one of the potentialtherapeutic agents to overcome EMT induced AR to EGFR TKI ,AR,EGFR,1
PIKCA and PTEN mutation The phosphatidyl insositol kinasePIKAKT pathway is  key downstream signalling pathway fromEGFR,PIK3CA,PTEN,1
 Mutation in PIKCA was identied in  of EGFRmutant lung cancers that developed AR to EGFRTKI  and in  of untreated lung adenocarcinoma in coexistence with other oncogenic mutations in  of cases ,PIK3CA,AR,1
 Recently the combination of getinib plus BKM  panclass  PIK inhibitor has reported antitumor activity in patients with AR to EGFR TKI but  of patientshad late grade  toxicities such as rash and diarrhea,AR,EGFR,1
 Cells with knockdown of PTENwith constitutive PIKCA activation have  decient homologousrecombinant DNA repair and increased sensitivity to cisplatinand PARP inhibitors ,PIK3CA,DNA,1
 These results might suggest  possibletherapeutic effect of PARP inhibitors in tumors with AR to EGFRTKI by PTEN mutant mechanism,PARP,AR,1
HER amplication HER is found to be amplied by FISH in of tumors with AR to EGFR TKI versus only  of untreated tumors,HER2,AR,1

 MEK inhibitors reverseresistance in tumors with AR to EGFR TKI ,MEK,AR,1
BRAF mutation The RASRAFMEKMAPK signalling pathwaydownstream of EGFR plays  role in lung cancer tumorigenesis,BRAF,EGFR,1
Two BRAF mutations were identied in  tumor samples with AR to EGFR TKI,BRAF,AR,1
 In one case of BRAF mutation VE coexisted with TM mutation and EGFR exon  deletion while inthe other BRAF mutation GA concurred only with the sensitive EGFR mutation ,BRAF,EGFR,1
 STAT is reported to be  critical mediator of oncogenic effects of EGFR mutations ,STAT3,EGFR,1

 Getnib induces downregulation ofTS in MET amplied resistant NSCLC cells but not in those harbouring TM mutation suggesting that an antifolate drug plus TKIcould be of interest in EGFR resistant NSCLC with MET amplication,MET,EGFR,1
 However  recent dataset has showed that AR to EGFR TKI appears to be associated with low efcacy of brain RT compared toEGFRmutation patients and TKInave and to EGFRwildtypepatients ,AR,EGFR,1
 These clinical patterns of progression are related to different outcomes when AR to EGFR TKI occurs,AR,EGFR,1
ConclusionSeveral mechanisms of AR to EGFR TKI in EGFRmutant NSCLCpatients have been reported,AR,EGFR,1

  This  hypothesis  has  been  satised  by  the  lack  of  concomitant  alterations  at  RBand  CDKNA  and  at  ATM  and  TP  ,CDKN2A,ATM,1
  Notably  several  studieshave  reported  that  LKB  mutation  often  occurs  concurrently  withKRAS  mutation  in  NSCLC  whereas  LKB  and  KRAS  mutations  arerarely  found  in  tumors  with  an  EGFR  mutation  ,KRAS,EGFR,1

 KL SCC was enriched for gene sets of purine metabolismand pyrimidine metabolism Figures A and B correlating withenhanced cell cycle progression and DNA replication Figure SA,KL,DNA,1
Compared to KL ADC KP ADC not only expressed higher levelsof GPD and PPP signature genes but also was enriched forgene sets of pyrimidine metabolism Figures SCSE,KL,G6PD,1
 Given the observation of higher ROS levelin KL ADCthan SCC the lower PPP signatures indicate potential PPPderegulation in KL ADC,ROS,KL,1
Because GPD can regulate PPP activity and cellular redoxstatus Cairns et al,G6PD,PPP,1
  Ward andThompson  we modulated GPD expression to investigate whether PPP affects AST,G6PD,PPP,1
 In KL cells GPD overexpression signicantly decreased the ROS level Figure SG,KL,G6PD,1
 In KL cells GPD knockdown not only increasedthe ROS level and inhibited cell growth Figures SK and SLbut also upregulated several SCC signature genes Figure SM,KL,G6PD,1
 In vitro assays showed thatcaAMPK expression rescued glucose deprivationinduced celldeath by lowering the ROS levelin KL cells Figures SAand SB,ROS,KL,1
 However the numberof KLA ADC or SCC remained comparable to that in KL modelwith similar tumor burden Figure SJ and the KLA SCC alsoexpressed TTF Figure SK,KL,TTF1,1
Under limited glucose supply when PPP is deregulated themajor source of reducing equivalents for ROS clearance is supported by fatty acid oxidation FAO that is activated by theAMPKACC axis Jeon et al,PPP,ROS,1

 In the two LKB mutanthuman ADC with SCC signature the AMPKACC axis was alsoinactivated Figure C and the p cells expressed higherlevels of GPD and CPTA than adjacent TTF cells Figure D,G6PD,CPT1A,1
Moreover in the four human AdSCC without LKB expressionalthough the AMPKACC axis was inactivated in both adenomatous and squamous components the latter consistently showedhigher expression levels of GPD and CPTA Figures E andSD,G6PD,CPT1A,1
 Based on the ndings in KL mouse lung tumors theseresults thus suggest  correlation of differential PPP and FAOsignatures with the pathological heterogeneity in  subset ofhuman ADC and AdSCC with LKB inactivation,KL,PPP,1
 Given that phenformin efcientlyinduced ROS in LKBdecient cancer cell lines Figure SAwe reasoned that KL tumor plasticity and heterogeneity mightaffect phenformin therapeutic response,ROS,KL,1
 Our data support that ROS accumulation in KL ADC may be derived from theredox imbalance involving ROS generation by PPP deregulation and impairedROS alleviation due to defective activation of FAO downstream of the AMPKACC axis Figure J,ROS,KL,1
 Given the differential ECM signatures between KL ADC and SCC Han et al,ECM,KL,1
 PPP deregulation can be attributed to the nutrient limitation during ECM remodeling,PPP,ECM,1

In  addition  we  proposed  that  the  inactivation  of  AKT  wasinvolved  in  the  downregulation  of  TP  expression,AKT,TP,1

 However in this model RRM expression did not correlate with OS,RRM1,OS,1
They also found that AQUA scores of RRM signicantly correlatedwith ERCC scores but not with PTEN scores,RRM1,ERCC1,1
 In addition utilizingthe expression levels of both RRM and ERCC they identied agroup of patients whose tumors had high expression of both markers  of  patients and these patients had signicantly longermedian DFS and OS compared to the other groups of patients,RRM1,OS,1
 conclusion from this investigation is that RRM expressionalone and in particular in combination with ERCC expression has prognostic signicance in resected earlystage NSCLCpatients,RRM1,ERCC1,1

 Western blot analysis on  NSCLC celllinesshowed that the phosphorylation levels of AKT andor ERK weresignicantly increased by stimulation with SDF Figure ,AKT,ERK,1
 Together with our cell line data showingthat activation of CXCR by SDF is followed by phosphorylationof AKT andor ERK signaling pathways we suggest that cytoplasmicCXCR may promote EMT and tumor progression,CXCR4,AKT,1

  Caseseries  have  demonstrated  that  KRAS  mutations  are  not  mutuallyexclusive  with  EGFR  mutations  or  the  EMLALK  rearrangementLee  et  al,KRAS,EGFR,1
  Furthermore  the  coexistenceof  other  molecular  events  such  as  TP  or  STK  mutations  seems  todifferentiate  KRAS  mutated  NSCLC  in  nonoverlapping  subgroupswith  enhanced  proliferation  and  immunoediting  and  potent  suppression  of  immune  surveillance  respectively  Schabath  et  al,TP53,STK11,1
  For  examplein    retrospective  analysis  patients  harboring  KRAS  mutations  hadshorter  survival  compared  with  KRAS  WT   Hazard  ratio  HR  ,KRAS,WT,1
  for  KRAS  mutated  and  WT   tumors  respectively    ,KRAS,WT,1
  When  comparedto  KRAS  WT   patients  treatment  with  chemotherapy  alone  resultedin  similar  time  to  progression  TTP    versus  ,KRAS,WT,0
  On  the  other  hand  in    single  institutionstudy  of    KRAS  mutated  patients  with  advanced  disease  treatedwith  chemotherapy  both  PFS  and  OS  were  shorter  compared  withmatched  controls  ,KRAS,OS,1
  of  KRAS  mutated  patientsreceiving  rst  line  chemotherapy  with    platinum  and  either    taxane  or  pemetrexed  the  platinumtaxane  combination  improvedORR  and  PFS  but  not  OS  in  both  the  entire  study  population  andin  patients  harboring  the  GV  mutation  patients  with  the  GCor  GD  mutations  derived  the  same  benet  from  the  pemetrexedcombination  compared  to  platinumtaxane  Mellema  et  al,KRAS,OS,1
  EGFR  inhibitorsMost  published  data  underscore  the  negative  predictive  valueof  KRAS  mutations  in  patients  receiving  EGFR  TKIs  as  shown  in  ametaanalysis  of    studies  Mao   et  al,EGFR,KRAS,1
  Similarly  in  the  previously  mentioned  TRIBUTE  trial  KRAS  mutated  patients  assignedto  the  triplet  combination  of  paclitaxel  carboplatin  and  erlotinibhad    trend  for  worse  ORR  and  also  experienced  shorter  TTP  andOS  compared  to  KRAS  WT   ones  Eberhard  et  al,KRAS,WT,1
  trial  KRAS  mutationswere  not  predictive  for  OS  in  patients  treated  with  erlotinib  compared  to  placebo  at  the  second  and  third  line  settings  howeverKRAS  WT  patients  had  improved  OS  when  treated  with  erlotinib    ,KRAS,OS,0
In  parallel  with  the  case  of  rst  line  chemotherapy  specic  pointmutations  may   be  predictive  for  EGFR  TKIs  in  KRAS  mutant  NSCLCin    pooled  analysis  of  four  trials  of  EGFR  TKIs  versus  placebo  thepresence  of  KRAS  mutations  was   neither  prognostic  nor  predictive,EGFR,KRAS,1
Recently  the  coexistence  of  TP  mutations  in    ofpatients  with  KRAS  mutations  was  shown  to  select    patient  subset  characterized  by  active  immuno  editing  and  higher  levels  ofsomatic  mutations  immune  effect  or  molecules  and  inammationmarkers  Schabath  et  al,TP53,KRAS,1
  Conceivably  the  simultaneous  presence  of  KRAS  and  TP  mutations  inlung  adenocarcinoma  may   select    patient  population  enriched  forimproved  clinical  outcomes  and  greater  benet  following  treatment  with  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  thus  representing  amuch  needed  predictive  biomarker  for  the  use  of  PDPDLinhibitors  especially  since  the  coexistence  of  KRAS  and  eitherTP  or  STK  mutations  seems  to  promote  resistance  to  docetaxelmonotherapy  in  animal  models  Chen  et  al,KRAS,TP53,1

  In  the  case  of  KRAS  mutated  NSCLC  preliminary  data  demonstrate  that  synthetic  lethality  could  be  inducedby  the  inhibition  of  several  targets  such  as  CDK  Puyol  et  al,KRAS,CDK,1

  As  demonstratedin  this  review  several  lines  of  evidence  suggest  that  different  pointmutations  of  the  KRAS  gene  exhibit  variable  predictive  signicancewith  some  inducing  differential  sensitivity  to  specic  chemotherapeutics  and  others  mediating    deleterious  effect  from  EGFR  TKIs,KRAS,EGFR,1

 EZH predicts poor patient prognosis with VEGF overexpression and AKT activation in lung cancer,EZH2,AKT,1
 These data suggest that VEGF induces AKT phosphorylation but does not affect EZH activity in H and A lung cancercells,AKT,EZH2,1
 These data suggest that EZH regulatesVEGF activity through the AKT signaling pathway in H andA lung cancer cells,EZH2,AKT,1
 The present study demonstrated thatin vitro overexpressing EZH upregulated VEGF expression andactivated AKT phosphorylation while silencing EZH had the opposite effect suggesting that EZH regulates VEGF expression inlung cancer progression possibly through the PIKAKT signalingpathway,EZH2,AKT,1
 These results suggest that VEGF regulates AKT phosphorylation without affecting the activity of EZH,AKT,EZH2,1
 VEGF induces AKT phosphorylation but not EZH activity,AKT,EZH2,1

 Although VE BRAF mutations result in tumor development through their intrinsic  ability  to  hyperactivate  the  MEKERK  pathway  nonVE  BRAF  mutations induce this pathway at lower levels and are significantly coincident with KRAS mutations in human cancer specimen the latter which may be required for malignant transformation,BRAF,KRAS,1
 The implication here is that currently there is no need for  stratification  in  clinical  trials  based  upon  BRAF  mutation status in contrast to EGFR mutations or Alk rearrangements,BRAF,EGFR,1
Perhaps the most interesting finding in the series reported by  Latvik  is  the  observation  that  in  secondary  lung  cancers approximately  harbored  KRAS mutation and one patient had  an  activating  EGFR  mutation,KRAS,EGFR,1
 Although reported infrequently  BRAF  mutations  do  occur  in  concert  with  other activating mutations in particular EGFR and KRAS mutations,BRAF,EGFR,1
 This  finding  may  have  implications  for  the  development  of resistance to BRAF inhibitors in advanced disease  case report published in this journal by rudin et al found  KRAS mutation in  BRAFmutated tumor upon progression on treatment with  vemurafenib,BRAF,KRAS,1
 The observation that second lung primaries reported by Litvak et al may contain KRAS and EGFR mutations may therefore have implications for the management of advanced BRAFmutated lung cancer patients and calls for detailed molecular analysis of relapse tumor samples,KRAS,EGFR,1

Conclusion   miR   is   involved   in   acquired   resistance   of  EGFRTKI   in   NSCLC   which   is   mediated   by   downregulating  PTEN   and   PDCD   and   activating   PIKAkt   pathway,PTEN,PDCD4,1
  Since  the  PIKAkt  signaling  is  amajor  downstream  EGFR  pathway  which  is  negatively  regulatedby  PTEN  while  PTEN  and  PDCD  expression  is  reversely  correlated  with  miR    we  thus  hypothesize  miR  also  playsan  important  role  in  the  acquired  resistance  to  EGFRTKIs,EGFR,PTEN,1

 Using gene ontology analysis we uncovered thatcoexpression of GFPFAK and PIAS correlates with activation ofseveral transcriptional programs that include DNA damage repair genesoxidative phosphorylation genes and  pancreatic adenocarcinomasignature Figure D,PIAS1,DNA,1
 This finding suggests that nuclear FAK mayparticipate in DNA repair and cell cycle progression  hypothesisconsistent with the known function of PIAS in these processes ,DNA,PIAS1,1
Because FAK deletion led to DNAdamage hypersensitivity shownby HAX and pCHK activation we speculate thatthecoamplification of FAK and PIAS promotes DNA damage repairproviding  survival advantage to genomically unstable tumors,PIAS1,DNA,1

 Of note the combined knockdownof ZEB and ZEB led to apparent synergistic responses in gene expression,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 Finally the absenceof ST matriptase was linked to ZEB positivity in lung cancer tissue microarrays implying that the regulation observed in vitro applies to the human disease,ST14,ZEB1,1
 In summary thisstudy identies  new set of ZEBregulated genes in human lung cancer cells and supportsthe hypothesis that ZEB and ZEB are key regulators of the EMT process in this disease,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 These results suggest that both ZEB and ZEB play  role inspecic aspects of the EMT phenotype in lung cancer,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 Expression of the negatively correlated genes clustered with cadherin and was opposite to theexpression of ZEB and ZEB,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 Conversely FGFR and Vimentin levelswere predominant in cell lines expressing ZEB and ZEB,FGFR1,ZEB1,1
 As anticipated Snail mRNAexpression did not correlate with these genes and the cadherin expression pattern showed considerably less clustering with ZEB than didVimentin and FGFR,ZEB1,FGFR1,1
 We also tested SIRT which was positively correlated with ZEB Table  but represented by  single Affymetrix ID,ZEB1,ID,1
Gene expression at the protein level was conrmed by Western blotsfor ZEB ST EpCAM and Vimentin along with cadherin and cadTable Changes in gene expression induced by exogenous ZEB or ZEB in H cells,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 ZEBcorrelated genes are responsive to ZEB and ZEB overexpressionas well as downregulationTo determine whether ZEBcorrelated genes were responsive tochanges in ZEB and ZEB expression we separately overexpressed thesegenes in H cells using  doxinducible system,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 These cells were chosenbecause of high endogenous cadherin expression low ZEB and barelydetectable ZEB Fig,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 H cells containing empty vector control ctland Myctagged ZEB or ZEB were exposed to doxycycline for    and days,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 ZEB induction led to afold upregulation of endogenous ZEB mRNA by day ,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 In contrast ZEB induction had little to no effecton ZEB mRNA,ZEB2,ZEB1,1
 As predicted by the Spearmancorrelations EpCAM ESRP ESRP CDS and ST mRNA levels weredownregulated following ZEB induction while Vimentin and FGFR levels were increased,CDS1,ST14,1
  H H andH cells expressed elevated levels of ZEB and ZEB and had absentEcadherin,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 cadherin ST and EpCAM proteins are decreased by exogenousZEB or ZEB in H cells,ST14,ZEB2,1
Protein lysates were analyzed by Western blot for induction of ZEB or ZEB  using antimyc antibodies,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 Protein levels for cadherin CDS and EpCAM in H cellswere increased by knockdown of ZEB Fig,CDS1,ZEB,1
 As previously observed forEcadherin  EpCAM levels were greatly increased by the combinedknockdown of ZEB and ZEB,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 Together these results demonstrate thatthe ZEB negatively correlated genes are also responsive to ZEB overexpression and downregulation whereas Vimentin and FGFR are predominantly responsive to ZEB overexpression,ZEB,FGFR1,1
 ZEB and ST staining in human lung cancersTo determine if  correlation could be found in vivo between ZEB andone of the new ZEBresponsive genes we examined ST expression byimmunohistochemistry on  TMA containing  series of  human lungtumors,ZEB1,ST14,1
An inverse pattern of expression was observed between the immunostaining for ZEB and cadherin or ST Fig,ZEB1,ST14,1
 and between ST and ZEB   ,ST14,ZEB1,1
 Of note ZEB positivecells were present in   tumors that had lost cadherin andsimilar results were observed for ST  ,ZEB1,ST14,1
 These results indicatethat when ZEB positive cells are found in the stroma there is less probability to nd cadherin or ST in the tumor compartment,ZEB1,ST14,1
Among the positive correlates were the mesenchymalmarkers Vimentin ZEB and FGFR,ZEB2,FGFR1,1
 cadherin CDS and EpCAM are increased by ZEB or ZEBknockdown in H cells,CDS1,ZEB1,1
 However the combined inhibitionof ZEB and ZEB increased the expression of several ZEBdownregulated genes in  synergistic manner Table Fig,ZEB1,ZEB2,1
 Our nding that EpCAM is ZEBresponsive is consistent with previous reports of low EpCAMand high ZEB associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitorsR,ZEB1,EGFR,1

 In  lung cancers we found that ST stainingwas highly signicantly correlated with cadherin andnegatively associated with ZEB Fig,ST14,ZEB1,1

 MET amplicationhas been detected in approximately  of EGFR mutantNSCLC patients as  mechanism of acquired resistance toEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors TKIsEngelman et al,MET,EGFR,1
 They involve diverse mechanisms ofaction and are either monoclonal antibodies directed againsteither HGF or MET or small molecule MET TKIs Peters andAdjei  Sadiq and Salgia  Spigel et al,HGF,MET,1
 TKIs targeting MET include ATP competitive and nonselective smallmolecules as cabozantinib XL  Exelixis inhibiting METRET VEGFR AXL Tie KIT and Flt crizotinib PFPzer inhibiting MET ALK and ROS and foretinib XL Exelixis inhibiting MET RON VEGFR PDGFR Flt Tie andKIT,MET,ATP,0
 In contrast tivantinib ARQ  DaiichiSankyo hasbeen reported to be  noncompetitive ATP and highly specicorally bioavailable small molecule for MET,ATP,MET,1
We aimed to evaluate the efcacy of tivantinib and nonselective MET inhibitors in  panel of NSCLC cell lines selectedon the basis of their MET dependency as well as those withEGFR and KRAS mutations or ALK translocation representingthe genomic diversity of NSCLC,MET,KRAS,1
Cell cultures and reagentsThe NSCLC cell lines A H the EGFR mutant NSCLC celllines PC Del EA PC GR Del EATMHCC and HCC GR and the MET amplied cell linesH EBC were grown in RPMI  supplemented with FBS and  AntibioticAntimycotic Invitrogen,EGFR,MET,1
  crizotinibPF Pzer is an ATP competitive MET and ALK inhibitoralready clinically approved for the treatment of ALK translocated tumors Camidge et al,ATP,MET,1
We next evaluated the inhibition of activity on MET andboth MAPK and PIK signaling in the A and PC cells,MET,MAPK,1
 HCC GR is  getinibresistantversion of HCC harboring the same EGFR exon  deletionas the parental HCC but with MET amplication as  mechanism of acquired resistance to getinib Engelman et al,EGFR,MET,1
 HCC GR exhibita codependency on both EGFR and MET and concurrent treatments with both an EGFR and MET inhibitor are required tosuppress their growth Engelman et al,EGFR,MET,1
 This inhibition of MET wascoupled with partial inhibition of ERK phosphorylationand no inhibition of AKT phosphorylation,MET,AKT,1
was no inhibition of MET phosphorylation or downstream effectors such as AKT or ERK Figure D,MET,AKT,1
 As wepreviously observed for PHA single agent crizotinibresulted in partial inhibition of MET phosphorylation andERK phosphorylation and no inhibition of AKT phosphorylation Figure B,MET,AKT,1
 These ndings provide further evidence that the antiproliferative activity of tivantinib is notcorrelated with MET dependency and collectively suggestM                           e  Figure   METdependent cell lines are sensitive to tivantinib crizotinib and PHA but only crizotinib and PHA blocks METPIKAKT and ERK signaling,MET,ERK,1

 Furthermore thecomplete abrogation of both MAPK and AKTPIKmTOR pathways has been seen as necessary for the complete efcacy of aMET inhibitor in MET dependent cell lines Lutterbach et al,MAPK,MET,1
While MET phosphorylation was inhibited with progressiveconcentrations of the drug no complete inhibition of bothERK and AKT was observed at concentrations of  mM adose that was nearly the double than the IC required toinhibit the proliferation of these cells Munshi et al,MET,AKT,1

 Based on these findings we speculated that miRp mighttarget CCND and USP to inhibit NSCLC growth,CCND1,USP28,1
 We determined the expression of miRp CCND andUSP by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays respectively and founddownregulation of miRp and upregulation of CCND and USP in NSCLC tissues and cell lines,CCND1,USP28,1
 Cellproliferation and apoptosis assays showed that miRp suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis inNSCLC cells and silencing CCND and USP both recapitulated the effects of miRp on NSCLC cells,CCND1,USP28,1
Furthermore we verified that CCND and USP were direct targets of miRp and also found that theeffects of NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis by miRp were attenuated by overexpression of CCND orUSP,CCND1,USP28,1
 These results confirmed our speculation that miRp inhibits proliferation and inducesapoptosis in NSCLC cells by targeting CCND and USP,CCND1,USP28,1
 Whereafter we performed the luciferase reporter assay toidentify whether the UTRs of CCND and USP mRNA arebinding targets of miRp,CCND1,USP28,1
 Expression levels ofCCND and USP mRNA were normalized to GAPDH,USP28,GAPDH,1
 In additionthe expression levels of CCND and USP protein in xenograftswere determined by Western blot,CCND1,USP28,1
 qRTPCR assays show that NSCLCtissues have  marked decrease in miRp expression andsignificant increases in CCND and USP mRNA expressioncompared with adjacent normal tissues Figure  ,CCND1,USP28,1
 Western blot assays show that the expressionlevels of CCND and USP protein in tumortissues aresignificantly higher than those in their corresponding normal tissuesFigure   and ,CCND1,USP28,1
 These results indicate that downregulation of miRp andupregulation of CCND and USP exist in NSCLC tissues andmiRp expression is inversely associated with the expression ofCCNDUSP mRNA,CCND1,USP28,1
Downregulation of CCND and USP Inhibits Proliferationand Induces Apoptosis in A CellsThe expression levels of CCND and USP in different NSCLCcell lines and MRC cells were detected by qRTPCR and Westernblot respectively,CCND1,USP28,1
 Compared with MRC cells all NSCLC cell linesshow significant upregulation of CCND and USP mRNA Figure  and ,CCND1,USP28,1
 The protein levels of CCND and USP are alsosignificantly increased in NSCLC cell lines compared with those inMRC cells which are completely consistent with the results ofqRTPCR Figure   and ,CCND1,USP28,1
 To further investigate the functionalroles of CCND and USP in NSCLC cells we transfected Acells with siCCND siUSP or the negative controls and thenpreformed cell proliferation and apoptosis detection,CCND1,USP28,1
CCND and USP Are Targets of miRpTo explore the mechanism underlying miRp involvementin proliferation and apoptosis in NSCLC cells TargetScan andmiRanda online tools were used to search for the target genes and weTranslational Oncology Vol,CCND1,USP28,1
 miRp is downregulated and CCND and USP are upregulated in NSCLC tissues,CCND1,USP28,1
  qRTPCR shows that NSCLCtissues have  marked decrease in miRp expression and significant increases in CCND and USP mRNA expression comparedwith adjacent normal tissues,CCND1,USP28,1
  and  The protein levels of CCND and USP in NSCLC tissues are detected byWestern blot,CCND1,USP28,1
found that CCND and USP are putative targets of miRpFigure   and ,CCND1,USP28,1
 In line with binding data the results showthat miRp markedly suppresses the luciferase activity of theWT CCND or USP UTR without effect on the MUT UTRwhich indicates that CCND and USP are direct targets ofmiRp Figure   and ,CCND1,USP28,1
 Furthermore we examined theexpression of the endogenous CCND and USP in A cellstreated with miRp mimics or negative control,CCND1,USP28,1
 As expectedupregulation of miRp results in  significant decrease inCCND and USP expression at both the mRNA and proteinlevels which indicates that miRp regulates CCND andUSP expression through binding to UTRs of their mRNAresulting in both degradation and translational repression Figure ,USP28,CCND1,1
 In combination with  significant negative correlation betweenexpressions of miRp versus CCND mRNA and USPmRNA in NSCLC tissues these results suggest that CCND andUSP are functional targets of miRp and miRpaffects proliferation and apoptosis in A cells by targeting CCNDand USP,CCND1,USP28,1
miRp Regulates Proliferation and Apoptosis in ACells by Inhibiting CCND and USP ExpressionTo explore the functional relevance of miRp and its targetsCCND and USP we measured whether CCND or USPoverexpression could reverse the effect of miRp on cellproliferation and apoptosis,CCND1,USP28,1
 As illustrated in Figure   comparedwith control cells CCND and USP are downregulated at bothmRNA and protein levels by ectopic expression of miRphowever pcDNACCND and pcDNAUSP robustly overturnthis decreased expression of CCND and USP induced bymiRp,CCND1,USP28,1
However overexpression of CCND and USP fails to fully restorethe effect of miRp on proliferation and apoptosis probablydue to  sufficiently high endogenous level of CCND and USPalready existing in A cells,CCND1,USP28,1
 Taken together our results reveal thatmiRp inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in Acells by regulation of CCND and USP expression,CCND1,USP28,1
 Inaddition the expression levels of CCND and USP protein inxenografts were examined by Western blot,CCND1,USP28,1
 Results show thatCCND and USP protein expression levels are decreasedcompared with the control group Figure C suggesting thatmiRp negatively regulates CCND and USP in vivo,USP28,CCND1,1
 CCND promotes G progression by formingactive holoenzymes with CDK and CDK and sequentiallyphosphorylates the retinoblastoma proteins pRb,CCND1,CDK4,1
 Downregulation of CCND and USP inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in A cells,CCND1,USP28,1
  and  The protein levels of CCND and USP are detected by Western blot,CCND1,USP28,1
  and  A cells with the lowendogenous CCND or USP level after transfection with siCCND or siUSP show higher apoptosis rate compared with cells treatedwith sicontrols,CCND1,USP28,1
 reported that USP can control MYC stability and thestabilization of MYC is required for proliferation of several tumor cellstypes,USP28,MYC,1
 CCND and USP are direct targets of miRp,CCND1,USP28,1
  and  Specific locations of the binding sites in miRp and UTRsof CCND or USP are marked,CCND1,USP28,1
  and  The luciferase reporter assay shows that miRp significantly suppresses the luciferaseactivity of reporters containing the WT UTRs of CCND or USP but has no significant effect on reporters with MUT UTRs,WT,CCND1,1
  and  Decreased expression of CCND or USP mRNA isdue to miRp overexpression in A cells,CCND1,USP28,1
 We determined the expression levels of CCND andUSP and found that CCND and USP expressions are bothsignificantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cells,CCND1,USP28,1
 In addition we determined the expressionlevels of CCND and USP in A cells following the treatment ofmiRp mimics,CCND1,USP28,1
 miRp regulates proliferation and apoptosis in A cells by inhibiting CCND and USP expression,CCND1,USP28,1
  and  ThemRNA levels of CCND and USP are determined by qRTPCR,CCND1,USP28,1
  and  Western blot analysisfor protein levels of CCND and USP,CCND1,USP28,1
  and  Upregulation of CCND or USP in A cellstransfected with miRp mimics partly relieves the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by miRp,CCND1,USP28,1
 Overexpression of CCND or USP in A cells transfected with miRp mimics partly reverses the induction ofapoptosis by miRp,CCND1,USP28,1
 Compared with the control group the miRp group has dramatic decreases in CCND and USP protein expression,CCND1,USP28,1
speculation that miRp inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation andpromotes apoptosis by targeting CCND and USP,CCND1,USP28,1
Altogether miRp is downregulated in NSCLC tissues andcells and inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and promotes apoptosiswhereas CCND and USP are upregulated and silencing bothCCND and USP recapitulates the effects of miRp onNSCLC cells,CCND1,USP28,1

 The effect of XRCC genotype on the ability of  cell to repair DNA damage has been evaluated most commonly involving human lymphocytes challenged with  DNAdamaging agent with the repair ability compared across  individuals  having  different  genotypes,XRCC1,DNA,1
 For example removal of DNA adducts from two lymphoblast  cell  lines  exposed  to  vinyl  chloride  metabolite had been evaluated and showed that the efficiency of repair of DNA adducts in the XRCC  homozygous wildtype  cells was four times greater than the efficiency of repair in the homozygous variant  cells,DNA,XRCC1,1

 In such cases ALK rearrangement patterns were BA in  and IRS in eight cases which did not differ from patients with  combined FISHIHC positivity  and  respectively,ALK,IRS,1
 ALK alteration  was  not  shown  to  be  restricted  to  adenocarcinoma but  was  present  in  the  NOS  NSCLC  subtype,ALK,NOS,1
 These data challenge the detection strategies in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC that suggest limiting ALK screening to adenocarcinoma but the data are consistent with recent guidelines  from  the  National  Cancer  Comprehensive  Network  that recommend  analyzing  all  adenocarcinoma  and  NOS  NSCLC cases and limiting analyses for SCC to never smokers and small biopsy specimens version  available from www,ALK,NOS,0
 In addition among our discordant IHCpositive and FISHnegative cases two cases were found to exhibit high levels of ALK polysomy with clusters of equal to or more than six fusion signals without BA or IRS signals,ALK,IRS,1
 Such  cases  were  classified  among  atypical  FISHnegative cases  using  the  criteria  for  EGFR  amplification  in  NSCLC and most of them were IHC negative for ALK,EGFR,ALK,1
  To reduce  costs    hierarchical  testing  for  ALK  BRAF  human epidermal  growth  factor  receptor    HER  or    phosphatidylinositolkinase  catalytic  subunit  PIKCA  mutations in  EGFR  wildtype  and  KRAS  wildtype  samples  has  been discussed  on  the  basis  of  studies  reporting  the  absence  of concomitant  mutations  in  NSCLC  cases,EGFR,KRAS,1
  This  criterion has also been included in an algorithm for screening ALK in clinically  selected  patients  with  NSCLC  and  an  EGFR  and KRAS  wildtype status,ALK,EGFR,1
 Whether  such ALKpositive  cases with  concomitant  EGFR  or  KRAS  mutations  have    different  prognosis  or  response  to ALK  inhibitors  remains  to  be determined,EGFR,KRAS,1
  Fusion  of  EML  and ALK  is  associated  with  development  of  lung  adenocarcinomas  lacking  EGFR  and KRAS  mutations  and  is  correlated  with ALK  expression,EML4,ALK,1

 Parental H cells were seeded in well plates overnight to allow for attachment and were incubated with stepwise increasedconcentrations of ALK inhibitors in the presence of indicated EGFR ligands EGF and amphiregulin HER ligand NRG and IGFRligand IGF at  concentration of  ngml for  days,ALK,EGFR,1
  Parental H cells wereincubated with different concentrations of NRG and stepwise increased concentrations of ALK inhibitors for  days,NRG1,ALK,1
there is no increase in the total levels of AKT and ERK proteins in bothresistant cell lines as compared with the parental H cell line the levelsof AKT Ser and ERK ThrTry proteins were increasedin the resistant cell lines,AKT,ERK,1
 Our data showed Figure A that expression levels of EGFmRNA in both resistant cells were about twofold higher than those inthe parental H cells CHR H and LDKR H cellsexpressed two and sixfold higher IGF mRNA respectively than theparental cell line and both resistant cell lines expressed more thaneightfold higher NRG mRNA than the parental cell line,IGF,NRG1,1
 Additionally NRG also induces theH parental cells to become resistant to AP and PFtwo newgeneration ALK inhibitors in clinical development,NRG1,ALK,1

 In additionwe employed Karpas  and SUDHL cell lines two anaplasticlarge celllines which harbor ALK fusion geneNPMALK but express only  very low level of HER to test thesensitivities of these ALK inhibitors in these two cell lines in thepresence of NRG Supplementary Information  and found thatNRG did not affect the sensitivities to ALK inhibitors in these twoanaplastic large cell lymphoma cell lines,ALK,NRG1,1
 We evaluated several EGFR inhibitors either alreadyFDA approved or currently in clinical trials Table  includingerlotinib  firstgeneration EGFR inhibitor afatinib  secondgenerationirreversible EGFR inhibitor that targets wildtype EGFR the TMEGFR mutant and HER AZD  thirdgeneration irreversibleEGFR inhibitor selectively targeting the TM EGFR mutant andAZD  reversible ATP competitive broadspectrum inhibitor ofEGFR HER and HER,EGFR,ATP,1
 AP has been reported to be  dual inhibitor of ALK and EGFR mutantsand PF  has been reported to be effective against allknown ALKresistant mutations,ALK,EGFR,1
We also investigated the HER expression using Western blot butfailed to detect HER expression strongly suggesting that HER isnot  contributor to ALK resistance,HER2,ALK,1
