 Since our model suggest that cooccurrence of TP mutation with sensitizing EGFR mutation maycontribute to de novo resistance by enhancing EGFRHER heterodimerization we tested whether panHER inhibitors such as afatinibmay be more active by blocking heterodimerization of the open form ofEGFR with HER in this comutant cells than getinib We comparedthe cytotoxicity of getinib with panHER inhibitor afatinib againstBaF cells harboring EGFR GS mutation concurrently with orwithout TP mutation,EGFR,HER2,1

 Increased proteinabundance of GLI SMO PTCH and PTCH were observed in HTUSC cells with remarkably upregulated TUSC expression,PTCH2,TUSC3,1
Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed proteinprotein interactionbetween TUSC and GLI indicating that endogenous human TUSCwas physically associated with GLI Fig,TUSC3,GLI1,1
 Immunouorescenceanalysis showed that TUSC expression was mainly localized to thecytoplasm while GLI expression was localized to both the cytoplasmand the nucleus Fig,TUSC3,GLI1,1
 Overexpression of TUSC in A cells led toincreased GLI expression in the nucleus and decreased GLI expressionin the cytoplasm as compared with the control cells Fig,TUSC3,GLI1,1
 The expression level of catenin which upregulates the critical EMTactivator ZEB  alsodid not show evident change in TUSC overexpressed or silenced cellsas compared with the control cells Fig,ZEB1,TUSC3,0

 The expression levels of TUSC relative to ACTB were fold higher in the surgical NSCLC tissues than in the paired normaltissues   ,TUSC3,ACTB,1
  Immunouorescence stainingshowing decreased SMO expression in TUSC silenced A cells compared with the control group,SMO,TUSC3,1
 Interestingly inthis study we found that both the A and H cell lines known forharbouring KRAS mutation showed higher TUSC expression than theother NSCLC cell lines ,KRAS,TUSC3,1
 Meanwhile KRAS mutations are frequentlydetected in CRC and sporadic PTC  in which elevated TUSCexpressions have been documented and an oncogenic role of TUSC hasbeen suggested ,KRAS,TUSC3,1
 By contrast KRAS is not commonly mutated inprostate cancer breast cancer and ovarian cancer  in whichdownregulation of TUSC expression has been reported ,KRAS,TUSC3,1
Therefore the function of TUSC in carcinogenesis may be associatedwith context or tissuespecic molecular proles such as the mutational status of the KRAS gene,TUSC3,KRAS,1
 The ligand binding relieves the inhibition of PTCH receptorson another transmembrane protein Smoothened SMOtherebytriggering  cascade that leads to the activation of GLI transcriptionalfactors ,PTCH,GLI,1

  Immunouorescence staining showingthe localisation of TUSC in the cytoplasm and presence of GLI in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in A cells,TUSC3,GLI1,1
  Overexpression of TUSC in A cells leads to increased GLIexpression in the nucleus and decreased GLI expression in the cytoplasm as compared with the control cells,TUSC3,GLI1,1
 This may suggest that either the increaseof GLI expression level related with TUSC overexpression was notstrong enough to induce EMT transition or the EMT transition was notevident enough to be detected,GLI1,TUSC3,1
 Activation of the Hh signallinginhibits the Sufu activity thus allowing GLI and GLI to translocate tothe nucleus and bind to target genes to activate transcription ,GLI1,GLI2,1
 In this study we detected physical interactionbetween TUSC and GLI protein using coimmunoprecipitation analysis Fig,TUSC3,GLI1,1
 Here we also demonstrated that overexpressionof TUSC in A cells leads to increased GLI expression in thenucleus and decreased GLI expression in the cytoplasm as comparedwith the control cells Fig,TUSC3,GLI1,1
 Since expression of TUSC in thecytoplasm has been observed in ovarian cancer cells and CRC cellsbefore  it is possible for TUSC to interact with GLI andparticipate in the translocation of GLI from the cytoplasm to thenucleus,TUSC3,GLI1,1

Conclusion   Finnish   NSCLC   patients   have     similar   mutation   prole   as  other   Western   patients   howeverwith     higher   frequency   of   BRAF   mutations   but     lower   frequency   of  STK   and   ERBB   mutations,BRAF,STK11,1
   Moreover   TP   mutations   occurred   frequently   with   other   gene   mutations   most   commonly   with   KRAS   METEGFR  and   PIKCA   mutations,TP53,PIK3CA,1

Activating  KRAS  EGFR  BRAF  mutations  and  ALK  fusions  have  beenpostulated  to  be  mutually  exclusive    and  this  proposal  is  conrmed  in  our  study,BRAF,ALK,1
  Only  one  case  carrying    different  mutationsin  seven  genes  harbored  both  activating  KRAS  and  EGFR  mutations,KRAS,EGFR,1
Two  cases  harbored  concurrent  KRAS  and  BRAF  GlyVal  andSerAsn  mutations  that  have  been  previously  reported  ,KRAS,BRAF,1
  in  the  metaanalysis  can  be  explained  mainly  due  to  selection  of  only  EGFRKRAS  PIKCA  HER  and  ALK  wildtype  patients  in  that  study  ,HER2,ALK,1
  However  two  out  of  eight  STK  mutations  wereseen  together  with  KRAS  and  ve  with  TP,STK11,TP53,1
    similar  trend  ofconcurrent  STK    TP  and  KRAS    STK  was  reported  in    recentmetaanalysis  on  Western  ADCs  ,STK11,TP53,0
  Nearly  half  of  the  EGFR  and  BRAF  mutants  and  of  the  KRASNRAS  mutants  harbored  one  or  more  concomitantTP  mutations,EGFR,BRAF,1

PIKCA  and  TP  mutations  were  associated  with  SCCs  which  isconcordant  with  previous  studies  ,PIK3CA,TP53,1
  TP    and  KRAS  mutations    andmultiple  mutations    have  been  reported  to  predict  poorercancerrelated  overall  survival,TP53,KRAS,1
  ConclusionsThis  hot  spot  mutation  screening  of    large  Finnish  NSCLC  cohortsuggests  that  although  mutation  proles  do  not  differ  essentiallyfrom  other  Western  patients  mutations  in  BRAF  are  seen  more  frequently  and  those  in  STK  and  ERBB  less  often  in  Finnish  NSCLCpatients,BRAF,STK11,0

 Moreover statistical analysis revealed several proteins that were signicantlyoverexpressed in KRAS or EGFR mutant cell lines,KRAS,EGFR,1
 Bioinformaticsanalysis identied subsets of proteins that reect much of the observedproteome variability as well as  smaller number of proteins exhibitingsignicant overexpression in KRAS and EGFR mutant cells,KRAS,EGFR,1
   cell lines with EGFR mutations cell lines with KRAS mutations and  cell lines with neither EGFR norKRAS mutations were selected Supplementary Table  which werekindly provided by Roman Thomas Cologne Germany,EGFR,KRAS,1
 KRAS and EGFR as well as NRAS and BRAF mutations wereabsent in the remaining group of nine cell lines which we refer to ascontrol group in this study,KRAS,EGFR,1
 There was no obvious enrichment of KRAS orEGFR mutant cell lines in parts of the dendrogram indicating that on aglobal level inherent proteome diversity of different NSCLC cell linessupersedes potential effects common to Ras or EGFR oncoproteinexpression,KRAS,EGFR,1
 Thus it appears that EMT characteristics may have  moreprofound impact on proteome composition than the presence of keyoncogenic mutations in the KRAS or EGFR genes,KRAS,EGFR,1
 Based on these ndings we focused our analysis on therst three PCs and further explored to which extent they reectedproteome differences between the KRAS mutant EGFR mutant andcontrol cell line groups,KRAS,EGFR,0
 On PCscores of EGFR mutant cell lines were higher than for KRAS mutant orcontrol cell lines,EGFR,KRAS,1
 In contrast scores of KRAS mutant cell lines were higheron PC compared to the other two groups while on PC only EGFR andKRAS mutant groups showed  signicantly different distribution,KRAS,EGFR,0
 Assignments of cell linesto either control KRAS mutant or EGFR mutant groups or to clusters  and  are indicated,KRAS,EGFR,1
  PCA score distributions for control KRAS mutant or EGFR mutant cell lines are shown as box plots for PC PC and PC,PCA,KRAS,1
 Signicantly different proteins between NSCLC cell line groupsWhile PCA unveiled proteins contributing to proteome diversity andfurther revealed distribution differences for NSCLC cell line groups thistype of analysis does not identify protein expression differences specicfor genomic aberrations such as oncogenic KRAS and EGFR mutations,PCA,KRAS,1
 We performedseparate analyses to identify signicant proteins in either the KRAS orthe EGFR mutant group compared to the control cell lines,KRAS,EGFR,1
 Moreover we did not discriminate between thedifferent mutant KRAS or EGFR forms present in the analyzed cell linesSupplementary Table ,KRAS,EGFR,1
 On average both proteins were about threefold higherexpressed in KRAS mutant cell lines and in case of HSDB all ofthem contained higher levels than found in any of the nine controlcell lines,KRAS,HSD17B11,1
 Protein foundin signicantly different abundance in KRAS mutant  or EGFR mutant  cell linescompared to the control cell line group as identied by  mean rankbased statistical test,KRAS,EGFR,1
 In addition to illuminating NSCLC proteome diversitywe have mined our data for signicant expression differences in celllines harboring oncogenic KRAS and EGFR mutations,KRAS,EGFR,1
 Oncogenes associated with adenocarcinomainclude activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR gene and translocations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ALK  and ROS gene as well as KRAS hepatocytegrowth factor receptor MET  RET and human epidermal growthfactor receptor  HER mutations,ROS1,RET,0
 Interestingly adenocarcinomas in nonsmokers show  signicantly higher frequency ofmutations in EGFR ALK and ROS while smokers show  highfrequency of KRAS mutations suggesting potentially differentpathogenetic mechanisms of tumour development in smokersand nonsmokers,ALK,ROS,1

 In small cell carcinomainactivation of the tumour suppressor genes TP and Retinoblastoma  RB are  prerequisite in its development withfurther associations with MYC translocations described,TP53,MYC,1
 Drug resistance however typicallydevelops after  months of treatment due to further alterationsin ALK or activation of bypass signalling pathways includingEGFR KRAS and KIT,ALK,KRAS,1
ROSThe ROS gene chromosome q also encodes an RTK within theinsulin receptor subfamily and shares many similarities to ALK,ROS1,ALK,1
 KRAS mutations are common inNSCLC and are widely accepted to be mutually exclusive withEGFR mutations and ALK translocations,KRAS,ALK,1
 Considering the low incidence of EGFRor ALK aberrations in Caucasian NSCLC patients the detection ofa KRAS mutation can reduce the number of insufcient reportsfor the large number of samples with suboptimal neoplastic cellcontent and may prevent the need for some repeat biopsies,ALK,KRAS,0
 Molecular testing showed wild type KRAS and EGFR,KRAS,EGFR,1
 The addition of fusion panels to NGS technologyto detect ALK or ROS rearrangements makes it even moreattractive and reduces both costs and handson technical timerequired for FISH,ALK,ROS1,1

 More than  genes have beendetected as ROS fusion partners in NSCLC see next chapter fromthe rstly described and most common CD to the recentlyreported TPDL ,ROS1,CD74,0
An element of clear biological and clinical interest is the homology between ROS and ALK oncogenes ,ROS1,ALK,1
 Both activated by generearrangements in NSCLC ROS and ALK belong to the insulinreceptor superfamily are evolutionary conserved and thus share of their amino acid sequence within their ATPbinding sites,ROS1,ALK,1
 The criteria for ROS FISH interpretation in NSCLCare identical to those created for ALK rearrangement with twomain patterns as follows ,ROS1,ALK,1
The promising results of extractive methodologies applied inclinical practice to determine ROS rearrangement and the possibility of using transcriptbased methods in  singletube assay todetect several oncogenic fusions in ALK RET ROS and NTRK genescould limit the use of IHC and FISH methods in the near future and possibly favor the identication of gene rearrangements inblood biopsy ,ROS1,NTRK1,1
ROS testing into  practical algorithmIn light of the availability of specic inhibitors ROS rearrangement should be tested simultaneously with EGFR mutation and ALKrearrangement,ROS1,EGFR,1
ROS rearrangement is generally mutually exclusive with othergenetic alterations in NSCLC but  subset may concurrently harborEGFR KRAS  BRAF or MET oncogenic mutations ,ROS1,KRAS,0
 Differently from EGFR mutations and in line withALK rearrangements ROS fusions are equally found in Westernand Eastern populations ,EGFR,ROS1,0
The association of  ROS fusion with  KRAS mutation in the sametumor can have accounted to the lack of response to crizotinib as observed in ALKpositive patients harboring KRAS mutations,ROS1,KRAS,1
 Differently from the previous reported codons involved the does not correspond to ROS active site and SY substitutionsappear to induce crizotinib resistance by both preventing its accessto the enzyme active site and by increasing kinase activity the latter event reported for the corresponding ALK CY mutation,ROS1,ALK,0
 All the three codons documented as sites of ROS mutationsresponsible forresistance to crizotinib G D andS can be object of nucleotide substitutions in ALK kinasetoo G D and C ,ROS1,ALK,0
